He also shot and injured another woman in an attempted carjacking later. The suspect is identified as 45-year-old Shareef Allman. The San Jose Mercury News says he moonlighted as producer of a show called Real 2 Real on something called CreaTV in the area. (He interviews Jesse Jackson in one YouTube clip, which is in the gallery. Allman, who spread a message of non-violence, also has written a book called Amazing Grace about female victims of domestic violence, notes the Mercury News. The shooting spree occurred about 4:30am local time when a man left a safety meeting at the Lehigh Southwest Cement Permanente Plant, then returned with a rifle and a handgun, according to police. He fled on foot, and a massive manhunt is under way in the San Jose area. Schools are on lockdown, notes AP.",____rd Victim Dead in Quarry Shooting; Manhunt Still On,Trans(three),3

His attorney withdrew a bail request yesterday saying the family just doesn't feel comfortable for numerous reasons, including concern for the family of Helen Novak, whom Tristen allegedly killed with a walking stick, reports WBRE. The lawyer also cited the family's worries over the supervision, of work, of everything. The district attorney says the boy is not in the general population. He is not in solitary confinement and he is not in isolation. He is in a cell which I believe is next to the infirmary where he can come and go from the cell to the infirmary. The nearest juvenile detention facility is 80 miles away. The boy has been provided with coloring books and other forms of entertainment, and while he understands where he is, he's acting like a normal 10-year-old and talks about his prison outfit being a Halloween costume, says his lawyer. Tristen has been charged as an adult with homicide, but his lawyer plans to have the case transferred to juvenile court, a move the chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia tells the AP is a no-brainer. The fifth-grader is a little boy, she says. It's a horrible tragedy, but it's shocking that he suddenly turned into an adult because of conduct that he engaged in. She says he is among the youngest people ever charged with homicide in Pennsylvania. The youngest on record was 9 years old.","Murder Suspect, ____, Will Stay in Adult Jail",Copy(10),10
TRAIN_6,"(Oct 3, 2011 9:10 AM CDT) Tobacco companies were well aware that their products contained radiationâ€”and they discovered this decades ago, UCLA researchers studying 27 historical documents have found. The firms learned of the presence of polonium-210 in cigarettes in 1959, and they examined the radioactive material's effects during the 1960s, documents show. They found that it caused cancerous growths in usersâ€™ lungs, and figured out just how much radiation a typical smoker would inhale, but the companies didnâ€™t warn the public. Using the original calculations, the researchers determined that the radiation would lead to the deaths of 138 of every 1,000 smokers over 25 years, ABC News reports. Not only are you inhaling it, but you're emitting radiation when you smoke, and your family, your dog, your cat are all inhaling that radiation, says an expert. Whatâ€™s more, some of these radiation particles hang around for decades. The timing of the original discovery is notable, says an anti-smoking advocate: It happened in an era when Americans were crawling under our desks during school radiation drills, meaning the news would have likely had a huge impact. Polonium remains in cigarettes, and a rep for Philip Morris says itâ€™s no secret to public health experts.

TRAIN_8,"(Aug 7, 2013 10:14 AM CDT) A new study throws the whole concept of a due date into question, finding the length of pregnancy can naturally vary by as much as five weeks. The study of 125 women expands upon what the BBC reports are some fairly broad stats: Only 4% of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30% do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As LiveScience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. (The average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. The study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant. The emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is, says a study researcher. The upshot? Perhaps a delivered by date would be better than a due date, suggests a spokesperson for the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.","____ Months May Not Be 'Normal' Pregnancy, After All","Round(Divide(268,30),0)",9

Officials at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha have said Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, will begin treatment in the hospital's 10-bed special isolation unit, the largest of four such units in the US. Sacra, who's from the Boston area, opted to head to Liberia after hearing that two other missionaries were sick. He served with the North Carolina-based charity SIM.

Scratching off a 1 on the $20 ticket means a $250,000 jackpot, but when the former air-conditioner repairman tried to claim $500,000 after getting two 1's, he was told a printing error had made a 12 and an 18 look like 1's, with only smudges remaining of the latter digits, KOB reports. Wines was offered $100 in lottery tickets instead.

It has become the stuff of legend, but the tale of what happened on a two-month journey of more than 3,000 milesâ€”in an open boat, no lessâ€”has contained a number of inaccuracies, exaggerations and inventions, probably due to the scarcity of first-hand material, University College London researcher Tim Causer explains. That should no longer be an issue. Though the popular story is based on an edited version of one survivor's account, today, that first-hand accountâ€”the only thought to exist in relation to the first convicts deported to Australia in 1788â€”was released in full for the first time, AFP reports. The story is often told with a focus upon the figure of Mary Bryant, Causer notes. To wit, the Australian government presents a bio of Bryant, who was arrested for stealing a cloak and married husband William, also a convict, shortly after getting to the colony. They escaped on March 28, 1791, along with their two children and six others, by stealing the governor's cutter boat. The group paddled Australia's coasts until they landed at the Dutch settlement of Kupang on West Timor. For a time, they tricked their hosts into thinking they were shipwreck survivors, but were shipped back to England when the truth came out; four convicts and the two children died on that part of the trip. The account was likely recorded for survivor James Martin by prison officials upon his return to England, and it matches up with newspaper accounts and other primary sources, says Causer, who hopes Memorandoms by James Martin will help to create a more rounded story.

The Commerce Department says the first-quarter contraction was even more severe than the 1% annual decline it estimated a month ago. It was the biggest downward revision since 1976, according to Bloomberg. Two-thirds of the drop was due to a decline in health care spending.

In the absence of new evidence, Malaysia, Australia, and China have collectively decided to suspend the search upon completion of the 120,000-square-kilometer (46,300-square-mile) search area, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said after a meeting with his Australian and Chinese counterparts, the AP reports. He said the current search is being hampered by bad weather and damaged equipment, but it will still end by December. The minister said suspension of the search does not mean an end to it. Should credible new information emerge which can be used to identify the specific location of the aircraft, consideration will be given in determining next steps, he said, reading from a joint statement. But it was clear that the searchers have given up hope of finding the jetliner with less than 3,900 square miles left to be searched. In their statement, the ministers acknowledged that the likelihood of finding the aircraft is fading.

Little pearl-like teeth started coming out, one by one. Initially, we were collecting them, they were really like small white pearls. But then we started to get tired. We counted 232 teeth, 17-year-old Ashik Gavaiâ€™s doctor tells the BBC. At one point, they also took a chisel and hammer to remove fragments of a marble-like structure in the boyâ€™s jaw, the Telegraph reports. The surgery took seven hours and a four-person medical team in a Mumbai hospital. Turns out Gavai, from a village in western India, had a complex composite odontomaâ€”basically a benign tumor. It usually forms in the upper jaw and causes the gums to make lots of teeth, and it couldâ€™ve damaged Gavaiâ€™s jaw bone, the Mumbai Mirror reports. Gavaiâ€™s 18-month saga had become a cancer scare for his parents, who took him to Mumbai when the village doctors couldnâ€™t figure out what was causing swelling in the right side of his jaw. A month ago the swelling caused severe pain, and thatâ€™s when his parents feared the worst. Now that Gavai is back to having the normal 28 teeth, heâ€™s not out of the woods. Doctors say the condition could come back, especially if a tooth or fragment was left behind. Gavaiâ€™s case may be a recordâ€”the most teeth taken out of such a tumor was previously 37, the doctor says. Next stop: Doctors will apply for the Guinness Book of World Records.

A 15-year study of half a million British women finds that a woman who has undergone a tonsillectomy or appendectomy has a 49% and 34% higher chance of getting pregnant, respectively, than a woman with her appendix and tonsils intact, reports the Telegraph. A woman who's had both procedures has a 43% higher chance of getting pregnant. One of the researchers says the study confirms beyond doubt that removal of inflamed organs or organs likely to suffer from repeated inflammation, in women, improves their chances of pregnancy rather than reduces those chances, as some doctors believe. It isn't clear why the procedures are linked to increased fertilityâ€”doctors previously suggested scar tissue around the fallopian tubes after an appendectomy reduced the chance of pregnancyâ€”but it may simply be that women who have more sex are more likely to develop an infection. However, inflammation in the body can affect a woman's ovaries and womb, per the BBC, and it's possible that the removal of these tissues makes an alteration to their immune system that affects reproduction, says a scientist not involved in the study. If true, this may ultimately give doctors and scientists some new ideas for novel drugs or therapies to enhance women's fertility.

The towfish was being dragged by a search vessel and scanning the floor of the Indian Ocean when it hit the volcano. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, searchers plan to recover the million-dollar towfish, which is sitting under more than 8,500 feet of water, sometime in the future. The search vessel has a backup towfish but has to travel to Australia to replace the 2.8-mile cable it also lost in the accident, CNN reports. The trip will cause a 12-day delay in the search for the missing plane.

Something had been smoked in the pipe bowls and stems unearthed from William Shakespeare' garden in Stratford-upon-Avon; the question was what. Researchers in South Africa now have gas chromatography mass spectrometry to thank for their answer. A piece in the Conversation based on the report published in the South African Journal of Science explains the technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago. Eight of the 24 pipe-fragment samples tested were shown to contain cannabis; another had evidence of nicotine, and two more evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves. Of those, only four of the cannabis samples were from Shakespeare's garden; the others were from the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Study author Francis Thackeray writes that the research establishes that a wide range of plants were smoked in the area during the early 17th century, and he leans on Shakespeare's own words to try to draw connections. Thackeray references Sonnet 76, which refers to invention in a noted weed ; he interprets weed as cannabis and invention as writing.

The Royal Shakespeare Company has decamped from Stratford-upon-Avon to London, where they are mounting all the plays in repertory on a single set. Bloomberg reports on the unprecedented project, which calls on a cast of 34 to master 528 roles. For Michael Boyd, who has previously directed seven of the eight, mounting the Histories as one project required him to plot trajectories for his actors across the plays. The actors playing the French villians in Henry V, for example, are reincarnated later as Richard III and his henchmen. Will audiences be open to hours and hours of war, politics, and intrigue?

The death announcement by Denzinger's family says he was buried Saturday at a local cemetery near Osijek in eastern Croatia. Local media said he died in the hospital on Thursday. Denzinger was born in present-day Croatia, which was part of Yugoslavia at the time. He started serving with the Nazi SS at the age of 18, in 1942, while Croatia was under a pro-Nazi puppet regime. He was posted at several camps, including the Auschwitz death camp complex in occupied Poland. Denzinger moved to the US after the war, settling in Ohio, where he became a successful plastics industry executive. Years later, the Justice Department uncovered his past. In 1989, as US prosecutors prepared their case to strip Denzinger of his citizenship, he first fled to Germany and later to Croatia. Denzinger was among dozens of suspected Nazi war criminals and SS guards who collected millions of dollars in Social Security benefits after being forced out of the United States. An AP investigation into the issue resulted in a law in 2014 barring suspected Nazi war criminals from receiving US government pension benefits. Croatian authorities in 2014 opened an investigation of Denzinger's World War II service, but he was never tried.

I don't want to die and have somebody else do it, he tells the BBC, which has clips of the songs. I'm authoritative about what was done in the first place, and the new music deserves to be heard. Keys to the Highway was recorded in 1970, in what Robert Plant calls a particularly prolific time where we were learning about each other's capabilities. Jimmy and I were just fooling around. The Whole Lotta Love track is an early versionâ€”missing some vocals, slide guitar, the middle section, and first chorusâ€”which makes one realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is in the final track, Plant says. He adds a pretty frank assessment of his own skills at the time: My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn't I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it.

Brady had barred a third trial, saying the state could not try Woodfox fairly more than 40 years after the killing of guard Brent Miller. The 5th Circuit disagreed.

The Obama campaign and DNC raised a combined $75 million in July, but spent $91 million, the New York Times reports. About $40 million of that went to advertising, while the rest went to buy infrastructure and pay salaries for the campaign's much-vaunted ground operation. The result: Democrats have just $124 million in the bank. Republicans, on the other hand, have $186 million, after a blockbuster June and July that saw Romney and the RNC raise more than $200 million. At the same time, Romney spent less on advertising, and let loyal super PACs fill the gap. Romney's most notable PAC, Restore Our Future, raised $7.4 million in July, while Obama's Priorities USA raised just $4.8 million.

This is an amazing and shocking and unique sample, one geneticist and co-author of the studyâ€”published this week in the journal Natureâ€”tells the New York Times. Because long stretches of DNA break into smaller ones over many generations, the researchers predicted that the Neanderthal DNA in the 45,000-year-old bone would be less fragmented than it is in us today, and they were right. By estimating the rate at which those DNA strands fragment, they came up with the interbreeding estimate of 50,000 to 60,000 years ago.

The case is believed to be the biggest class-action lawsuit ever seen in Canada. Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan said in his decision that by choosing not to inform health authorities or the public directly of what they knew, the companies chose profits over the health of their customers. The judgment calls on the companies to issue initial compensation of more than $800 million in the next 60 days, regardless of whether they elect to appeal. The judge will decide at a later date how to distribute those funds. JTI-Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges say they will appeal. The Quebec case marked the first time tobacco companies had gone to trial in a civil lawsuit in Canada and involved two separate groups of plaintiffs: some of whom became seriously ill from smoking and others who said they couldn't quit. Riordan denounced the firms' actions. The companies earned billions of dollars at the expense of the lungs, the throats, and the general well-being of their customers, he wrote. If the companies are allowed to walk away unscathed now, what would be the message to other industries that today or tomorrow find themselves in a similar moral conflict?

Overall, 47% of respondents said there is a gun in their household. But the numbers may not actually reveal higher levels of gun ownership, Gallup notes; it could simply be that people are more comfortable reporting their gun ownership.

On Sunday night, those children became orphans when their father was shot to death outside a bar, reports the NBC Los Angeles. The kids range in age from 1 to 14, reports the Press-Enterprise. Santana's death occurred after she flew from California to Washington for a hiking excursion with her kids in the Big Four Ice Caves. The collapse killed her and left five others injured, including her oldest child with an ankle injury and her brother with a serious head injury. On Monday, the kids learned that their father, Adrian Cardona, 35, had been killed. Details of what happened are skimpy, but police think Cardona got into an argument with a woman at a bar in San Bernardino, which resulted in him getting shot while standing by his car.

Some 700,000 parents, many of them home-schoolers, have purchased the self-published tome, including parents who are either currently serving prison time or have been charged in the abuse and beating deaths of three young children in the last 5 years, reports the New York Times. Pearl says it's unfair to blame his book for the actions of unstable parents, but physicians and law enforcement authorities have expressed concerns about the book's role in child abuse. My fear is that this book, while perhaps well intended, could easily be misinterpreted and could lead to what I consider significant abuse, a pediatrician who examined one of the dead children told the Times. The book threatens to escalate violence against children because it advises that if you donâ€™t get results, the only thing to do is to punish harder and harder, says a woman who runs a Christian-based blog opposed to corporal punishment.

The lion was wearing a GPS tracker, and authorities say he was tricked into leaving the park, shot with a bow and arrow, tracked for 40 hours, and killed with a rifle outside the park on private land. Some hunters claim this means the kill was legal, while his brutal beheading has caused outrage in Zimbabwe and beyond. Authorities are now on the hunt for a Spaniard who allegedly paid a park guide $55,000 to kill the beloved lion, reports the Guardian; two people who accompanied him have been detained. The Zimbabwe Professional Hunters and Guides Association has confirmed on Facebook that the professional hunter on the hunting permit was one of its members, and the group has deemed the act unethical and suspended the hunter's membership indefinitely. Meanwhile, conservationists worry that as many as a dozen cubs are now vulnerable to infanticide as other males close in on the two prides led by Cecil and Jericho, a male with whom he was in coalition.

Whether the pilot's drinking habits had anything to do with the crash is unclear.

The Federal Aviation Administration might allow a recovering alcoholic to fly commercial jets if the pilot was being successfully treated, says an aviation safety expert. But the agency is unlikely to accept an airline pilot with convictions for driving under the influence, he adds. Nichols, 49, got his commercial license to pilot hot air balloons in Missouri in July 1996. His first drunk-driving conviction came in 1990, followed by two more convictions in 2002 and a fourth in 2010, according to online court records.

Violet Makoto, spokeswoman for Zimbabwe's forestry commission, said Monday that rangers discovered the carcasses of the elephants with their tusks removed in a western forest last week. Makoto says the poison was laced on salt licks, a method now regularly used by poachers to kill elephants in Zimbabwe. She says poachers killed four other elephants in the same area in February. No arrests have been made, but Makoto tells AllAfrica.com that we are suspecting a team of about five poachers. We came across a camp sometime ago, which looked like it accommodated about five people and we think it is the same team. The wildlife-rich southern African country has battled cyanide poisoning of wildlife by poachers for the past three years. Poachers killed 62 elephants by that method in October.

The $162 million garnered from the illegal transactions, or churning investigations, was used to offset the bureau's expenses as is allowed, but in one case, an informant kept $4.9 million of a $5.2 million payout without submitting proper paperwork. Even worse: none of the cases were approved by the ATF's Undercover Review Committeeâ€”it mysteriously didn't meet for almost seven years. Though not mentioned in the report, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel details one 2011 sting where a pallet of cigarettes was left behind, and thieves swiped two cases of smokes worth about $10,000. The report cited a serious lack of oversight, plus funds spent in improper, unnecessary, and unreasonable ways, but the ATF has come out swinging.

Doctors then turned their attention to Perez's unborn son. For the child to have any hope of survival, the pregnancy needed to be prolonged to an absolute minimum of 24 weeks.

According to the New York Times, the sexual transmission of Zika was thought to be rare. We were surprised that there was this number, the CDC's deputy director says. Thatâ€™s much more than I was expecting. Only two of the 14 cases have been confirmed so far.

The CDC is advising pregnant women to avoid sex or use a condom if their partners have been traveling to areas affected by the virus. Zika has been found in semen, and there is so far no evidence that infected women can pass it along to their sexual partners.

Bjorn Kjos' master plan is to connect flights from smaller coastal US airportsâ€”New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport have both been mentionedâ€”that offer lower fees than busier airports to European destinations such as Bergen, Norway, and Edinburgh, Scotland.

Further, the number of at-risk girls under age 18 more than quadrupled as compared to the 1990 numbers, per the study.

Though Congress made FGM/C illegal in 1996, the Guardian reports that vacation cutting is a way around this, where parents ship their girls to countries that allow FGM/C in order to have to procedure carried out. As for why the jump in risk, the CDC writes that the estimated increase was wholly a result of rapid growth in the number of immigrants from FGM/C-practicing countries living in the United States and not from increases in FGM/C prevalence in those countries. As for those countries, the WHO says the practice is concentrated in 29 countries in Africa and Middle East and says more than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut there.

A rep for the National Nuclear Security Administration says simply that the runway is used by the Defense and Homeland Security departments. They come here to test their own sensors, he says.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation hopes that the 35th anniversary won't arrive with the crime still unsolved: On Monday its director revealed a critical piece of evidence : a cable repair ticket book. At a press conference, Director Stan Florence explained that the book's final ticket logs work completed at the Neilsons' apartment at 11:51am on the day of her death, reports the Norman Transcript. The book has no company name on it, the Oklahoman reports; in the bottom left corner of the ticket is a box where the employee signed off on the work, and the ticket in question contains three letters. We want help in identifying those three letters, identifying who that person was that wrote in that book, said Florence. The ticket book has been in the bureau's possession for years; under a state law that was altered in 2011, the bureau finally had the ability to share the evidence with the public in hopes it will bring closure to the case. The bureau said it received a number of calls within a day of revealing the ticket. The Oklahoman reports that the 21-year-old's throat was cut, and she had been stabbed a number of times.

The secretive street artist's selling price, however, was decidedly lower: $60 per work. The collection, which was being sold by an elderly man, looked like it was full of fakes, the BBC notes; in fact, the works were signed by the artist, who posted about it on his website today. Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each, the artist noted on the site for his New York residency, called Better Out Than In. The stall took in just $420 all day, and some customers paid even less than $60; in a video, the BBC notes, one negotiates to get 50% off. But don't rush over for a deal: The stall will not be there again today, the artist posted, adding, I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached.

The wide-ranging scandal surfaced when a teenage girl who described herself as a prostitute said she had sex with about 30 law enforcement officials in Oakland and elsewhere in the region. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said she was waiting to formally file charges until the teen could be returned to California from Florida, where she has been jailed in an assault case, the AP reports. The prosecutor said she needs the teen to provide testimony in the case. O'Malley said the officers who will be charged are former Contra Costa sheriff's deputy Ricardo Perez; former Livermore police officer Dan Black; Oakland police officers Brian Bunton, Giovani LoVerde, and Warit Utappa; and former Oakland police officers Tyrell Smith and Leroy Johnson. The officers will be charged with a range of felonies and misdemeanors, O'Malley said. The teen, now 19, said she had sex with four officers before she turned 18 and sometimes traded sex for protection from arrest or tips about planned prostitution stings. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf previously said disciplinary action has begun against a dozen officers, including dismissal proceedings against four. Seven will serve a range of unpaid suspensions before being allowed to return to duty and another will be required to attend training classes.

Burwell. A rep for the Kaiser Family Foundation tells the Washington Post the new government figures offer the best assessment yet of how many Americans will be affected by such a decision. These are the people we now know are receiving subsidies that would be lost if the court sides with the challengers, he says. The plaintiffs argue residents of 34 states who bought coverage on the federal exchange aren't entitled to tax credits due to four words at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Most who would be affected come from two large area groups: one covering Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Texas, the other covering Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin. At an average of $272 a month, the subsidies total $1.7 billion per month. Some 2.1 million people would lose $595 million in subsidies per month in Texas and Florida alone. If forced to pay the cost of coverage in full, subsidized enrollees would face an average effective premium increase of 287%. Those in Alaska and Utah would face a 500% increase; Mississippi enrollees would see a 650% hike, researchers say. The Urban Institute estimates two-thirds of those receiving subsidies would give up their coverage without help, Politico reports. Those most at risk are white, employed, live in the South, and have modest incomes. If the Supreme Court revokes coverage, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Rick Scott both say the federal government will need to come up with a solution. Pennsylvania is the only state to put forth a backup plan, reports the Hill. Gov.

Since 1932, its whereabouts have been unknown, leaving behind only a single black-and-white photograph as evidence.

How they went about doing so is revealed in Karen Masterson's new book, The Malaria Project, which reports on the operation of the same name. Making use of National Archives records, Masterson documents how US troops and mental patients were used as pawns in the effort. Because malaria can't be grown in cultures, live subjects were needed: Strains were extracted from troops who had been exposed to malaria while abroad and then injected into thousands of mental patients and prisoners. But many troops also became unknowing test subjects, with devastating results: Some of the guys were ruined, sent home because they had so many malaria relapses, says Masterson. Their bodies were wrecked. As Time reports, doctors set out to test the top 100 potential drugs out of 14,000 compounds that had been made. Some troops were dosed with Mary (sulfamerazine), others with Atabrine. At best, the treatments were useless; at their worst, they left troops wrecked by organ damage. Masterson estimates 10% of infected mental patients died (she didn't record any troop deaths). What ultimately worked was what Masterson calls a magic formula stolen from the Nazis: Chloroquine went on to save more lives than any other drug in history, she tells NBC News, though malaria-causing parasites eventually developed resistance to it.

Each year, federal agencies are required to estimate the amount of improper payments they issue; the House Oversight subcommittee on government operations is holding a hearing on improper payments this afternoon. Some improper payments are the result of fraud, while others are unintentional, caused by clerical errors; others were deemed improper because they were issued without proper documentation. The Obama administration has reduced the amount of improper payments since they peaked in 2010 at $121 billion. Still, the federal government's own astounding estimate is more than half a trillion dollars over the past five years, said Rep. John Mica, the Republican chair of the subcommittee. The fact is, improper payments are staggeringly high in programs designed to help those most in needâ€”children, seniors, and low-income families.

It all boiled down to a single liquid: After all, ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume, he tells CNN. Suvir collected random teachers' handouts, then picked out the most commonly used lettersâ€”e, t, a, o, and râ€”and used four different fonts to determine which typeface used the least ink. He even weighed the printouts and graphed the ink usage, and with its thinner strokes, Garamond was the clear winner.

Although Obama has visited mosques overseas in the past, he waited until his final year in office to make such a visit at home, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, reports the AP. At the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama sat down around a large table with Muslim university chaplains, community activists, and public health professionals for a discussion about religious tolerance and freedom. An afternoon speech will address how the US can more successfully confront extremism if it works with Muslims instead of branding all of them as potential enemies. One of the participants meeting with Obama, Ibtihaj Muhammad, has qualified for a spot on the United States Olympic Team for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games. The White House said she'll make history as the first United States Olympian to compete in a hijab. (See this Buzzfeed profile on the fencer.)

Following through with recommendations from a grand jury in Monroe County, prosecutors say they will file third-degree murder charges. Police allege Chun Michael Deng, 19, was blindfolded, weighed down with a bag of sand, and told to walk toward a voice as other frat members tried to tackle him during an outdoor ritual known as glass ceiling. At one point, Deng complained that his head hurt after he'd been lifted and dropped on the ground, but he continued until he was knocked unconscious, reports the New York Times. He died later at a hospital. Thirty-two others face charges including aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, and hazing, reports CBS New York.

But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a perfect storm of lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply. In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls food insecure people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from moderate malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected. The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time, Cousin says. We must act now before it is too late. Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible, per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with extreme food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida.

The complaint states Marie Hatch moved into her Burlingame cottage more than 60 years ago at the request of her friend Vivian Kroeze, who owned the property and needed companionship after her husband died. Hatch was promised a lifetime tenancy, and the promise was honored by Kroeze's daughter and granddaughter after Vivian Kroeze died in 1980.

Kumar, 62, had an ectopic pregnancy when she was 24, and was told the fetusâ€”growing outside of her wombâ€”would likely not survive, the International Business Times reports. At some point, She apparently knew that the baby had died and that she would need an operation, but she was scared of surgery and fled the hospital, instead opting to get treatment for her abdominal pain at a small clinic, her doctor says, according to the Daily Mail. When the pain came back decades later, however, she allowed doctors to remove the skeleton, which was inside a calcified sac, from her abdomen. We found a lump on the lower right side of her abdomen, and feared it was cancer. A CT scan then revealed that the lump was made of hard, calcified matter, one of the doctors says. But it was only after the patient underwent an MRI that we could make out that the mass was in fact a child's skeleton. The amniotic fluid that protects the fetus might have been absorbed and the soft tissues liquefied over time with only a bag of bones with some fluid remaining. The mass was removed from between Kumar's uterus, intestines, and bladder. Doctors believe it is the world's longest ectopic pregnancy; prior to this, the longest known case involved a Belgian woman who had the remains removed after 18 years.

The boy, IDed by the International Business Times as Abrahim Hassan, was born in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere. Abrahim's mother, Shaban, carries the gene for Leigh syndromeâ€”a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child's death before kindergarten. Although Hassan herself is healthy, her first two children died from the disease. That's when she and her husband looked for assistance from NYC's New Hope Fertility Center, where a team led by Dr. John Zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood. There are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique, but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out; that egg, which then contains nuclear DNA from the mom and mitochondrial DNA from the donor, is fertilized with the father's sperm. Five embryos were created in this case, and when just one took, it was implanted into Hassan, who delivered Abrahim nine months later. This all had to be done in Mexico, where Zhang says there are no rules (the Times labels it relatively flexible legislation ; the procedure isn't approved in the US). One concern scientists are keeping an eye on: faulty mitochondria that could replicate, a problem that may have occurred when the technique was last tried in the '90s.

It's also an acronym for International House of Prayer, a church that started praying on Sept. 19, 1999, and hasn't stopped. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, live music is playing and the church is packedâ€”even at 3am one recent morning, more than 100 people were worshiping as an 11-member rock band played, the Los Angeles Times reports. People visit from as far away as South Korea; recently, 27 US states and Mexico were represented in the parking lotâ€”around midnight. IHOP is part of the fast-growing perpetual prayer movement, and believes prayer is spiritual warfare against demons that have a hold on parts of society. It draws from a movement that outsiders call Dominionism, which seeks influence over areas seen as devil-infiltrated, including business, media, and government. The idea is controversial, and has led to some concern over the church's influenceâ€”it played a central part in Rick Perry's recent prayer meetingâ€”but the founding pastor laughs off such concerns.

Harmon, 24, who described himself as just a dude from Mississippi, waited tables at his family's restaurant in Amory before trying out for the show. American Idol, once a ratings powerhouse that influenced TV and music, suffered steady audience erosion before Fox decided it would end this season. The final show opened with a harmonizing chorus of white-clad winners and contenders, including Scotty McCreery, Taylor Hicks, and Diana DeGarmo. Other familiar faces from years past popped up in solos and group numbers. There was a nod to nostalgia, with clips from auditions presided over by original judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson. Abdul and Jackson showed up to salute Seacrest for his longevity, with Cowell strolling on stage belatedly to steal the spotlight. I'm feeling quite emotional now, he said. President Obama was the unexpected opening act. In pre-taped remarks, he congratulated the show on its long run, noted that it motivated millions of young people to vote for contestants, and urged American to demonstrate that same eagerness at the polls.","After ____ Years, American Idol Crowns Final Winner",Copy(15),15

Thatâ€™s how much the US pays, on average, for every gallon of fuel put into its planes and combat vehicles in Afghanistan, military officials recently told the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. It is a number that we were not aware of, and it is worrisome, John Murtha tells The Hill. The subcommittee had asked the Pentagon to break down why it spends about $1 billion for every 1,000 troops deployed. The fuel bill is so high because Afghanistan is both inaccessible and underdeveloped. Fuel has to be shipped in through Pakistan, and then, since roads are scarce, it often must be flown to remote forward operating bases.

In a video released Sunday, the online retail giant shows off a new hybrid delivery drone that can fly both vertically and horizontally.

NPR reports it was a 7.2% increase over 2014â€”the largest single-year increase since 1966 and, according to a press release, the end of a 50-year downward trend in traffic fatalities. Despite decades of safety improvements, far too many people are killed on our nationâ€™s roads every year, US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx says. Officials say the increase in deaths is attributable to more people driving due, in part, to job growth and cheaper gas, both of which lead to more young people driving and more people driving for non-work reasons. People are also driving longer distances, on average. Nearly half the traffic fatalities in 2015 were passengers who weren't wearing seat belts. And approximately 30% involved a drunk driver.

So reports evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar this month in the journal Royal Society Open Science, after analyzing research conducted in April and May of 2015 involving 3,375 people ages 18 to 65. While women typically have larger social circles than men, the average number of Facebook friends among this sample was 150, reports CNET. But the average number of friends one can truly count on in a crisis is just fourâ€”which reflects one's offline numbers, and is remarkably consistent across backgrounds, gender, and age. Dunbar defines several friendship levels, each panning out from the four or five closest friends the average person maintains, reports the Washington Post. From there, most of us widen the circle of sympathy friends we feel we can confide in to 15, and widen it again to 50 friends who are close. Most of us can't seem to maintain much more than 150 casual friends, though, and the typical realm of total acquaintances tops out at 500. Even those with thousands of Facebook friends aren't necessarily more social, Dunbar concludes: Respondents who had unusually large networks did not increase the numbers of close friendships they had, but rather added more loosely defined acquaintances into their friendship circle. And while social media can help slow the natural rate of decay that occurs over time, that alone may not be sufficient to prevent friendships eventually dying naturally if they are not occasionally reinforced by face-to-face interaction, he adds.

The study is the first national estimate based on a new term, alcohol use disorder, in a widely used psychiatric handbook (DSM-5) that was updated in 2013. Researchers from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism asked 36,000 adults during 2012 or 2013 about lifetime drinking habits, including current or within the past year. About 14% of adults were current or recent problem drinkers, or nearly 33 million nationally, and 30%â€”almost 69 millionâ€”had been at some point in their lives. Drinking problems were most prevalent among men, whites, and Native Americans. Low-income adults, those younger than 30, and those who never married also relatively high rates. Problem drinking also was more common among city dwellers than those in rural areas, while the West and Midwest had higher rates than other regions. The new handbook defines problem drinkers or those with the disorder as people with at least two of 11 symptoms, including drinking that harms performance at work, school, or home; frequent hangovers; and failed attempts to limit drinking.

A new study offers some illumination: It suggests a hot, unpredictable climate and high carbon dioxide levels kept some of the world's first dinosaurs awayâ€”and may shed light on our own issues with climate change. Researchers first analyzed ancient sedimentary rocks in New Mexico, which would have been much closer to the equator as part of the supercontinent Pangea some 215 million years ago, reports LiveScience. In separating carbon isotopes from fossilized organic matter, they identified significant and rapid changes to the ecosystem and atmospheric CO2 levelsâ€”which were four to six times those of today. Pollen and spores suggested available plants varied in quantity based on the frequent changes, while fossil charcoal showed evidence of wildfires every few dozen years that wreaked havoc on vegetation. The combined factors suggest an environment too unstable for sauropods until about 30 million years later, though small, carnivorous dinosaurs did populate the area. The conditions would have been something similar to the arid Western United States today, although there would have been trees and smaller plants near streams and rivers and forests during humid times, study author Jessica Whiteside explains in a press release. Eerily, she writes at the Conversation that rapid climate swings and extremes of drought and intense heat driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels have as much ability to alter the vegetation supporting modern human populations as they did for the large plant-eating dinosaurs in the Triassic.

That pronouncement, a conclusion that comes from an analysis of 24 studies based on randomized clinical trials and published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, is hardly a ringing endorsement. But as the Washington Post reports, we buy those supplements anyway, and lots of them: Americans spend roughly $1.2 billion each year on fish oil pills and associated products; one of the authors of that JAMA research told Reuters in 2013 that about 10% of Americans take them. They're touted for the good fatty acidsâ€”omega-3sâ€”they contain. But while they're generally considered safe to take, it's pretty unclear whether they're beneficial for heart health. Writing for the Post, Peter Whoriskey astutely points out that even the National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association can't really make up their minds. The former endorses the supplements, then states omega-3s in supplement form have not been shown to protect against heart disease on its website; a scientific consultant with the NIH says the endorsement was supplied by a third-party contributor. As for the AHA, it advises people battling heart disease to ask their doctor about the supplements, but a former AHA president tells Whoriskey, It would be a good time for that to be updated. As for those 24 aforementioned studies, all but two showed no benefit. But Whoriskey notes it's possible there is some, and our experiments on heart disease patients just can't pick up on it because heart medications cloud things. A 5-year study of 26,000 peopleâ€”who the New York Times terms more representative of the general population â€”is due to be completed in 2016.

The assault took place near Pakistan's tribal areas, over which its government has little sway. Last summer, the same battalion killed some 150 fighters in the region; afterward, the US attempted to build an Afghan police station there. But when American troops left the area, so did the police. The police were too scared the Taliban were going to come back and kill them, said a US commander. The people are still timid, and the police are timid.

The quake struck at 5:39am near the city of Edmond, which is a suburb north of Oklahoma City, according to preliminary data from the US Geological Survey. A smaller earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 3.4 hit the same area about 10 minutes later. No injuries were immediately reported, but the quake knocked out power to about 4,400 homes and businesses; electricity was restored quickly, Edmond spokesman Casey Moore said. Oklahoma has become one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world, with the number of quakes magnitude 3.0 skyrocketing from a few dozen in 2012 to more than 720 so far this year. Many of the earthquakes are occurring in swarms in areas where injection wells pump salty wastewaterâ€”a byproduct of oil and gas productionâ€”deep into the earth. As a result, state regulators have begun reducing the volume or shutting down disposal wells in response. The epicenter of Tuesday's quake was located just outside a previously implemented cutback zone, where disposal well operators were directed in July to reduce the amount of volume they inject, Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said.

To be more specific, Ebner said that the lip balm tube employs a twist-up mechanism that allows only 75% of the product to dispense beyond the tube opening. But the court noted that no state or federal laws were breached because the package labels accurately indicate just how much balm is in each tube. The court opinion stated, probably not to Ebner's liking, that the reasonable consumer understands the general mechanics of these dispenser tubes and that it is up to the consumer to decide whether it is worth the effort to extract any remaining product with a finger or a small tool.

Doctors report in the journal Pediatric Neurology that the jerkiness and gravitational forces of the ride appear to be the culprit, and that the tear resulted in a blood clot that traveled to the boy's brain, causing a stroke. The boy began vomiting the next day, then developed a droop on the left side of his face on the flight home and soon couldn't walk, reports Eureka Alerts. The doctors say that while several cases of stroke resulting from roller-coaster rides have been documented in adults, this is the youngest known caseâ€”in fact, they've identified only two other pediatric cases in medical literature, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a hypermobility that makes them more vulnerable to such tears, albeit rarely. Six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports CBS News.

So officials want to lift every building and fill in the land beneath with landfillâ€”a process that would send residents to temporary camps for about a month.

Critics say it's unclear why Highlands should get that kind of money over other coastal areas. It's a very expensive option, admits one official studying it. But the head of Highlands' Environmental Commission thinks a combination of federal, state, and private funding can make it happen. He's been backing the idea for years, well before Hurricane Sandy.

The AFP reports that the claim stems from documents uncovered by one historian that indicate that King Edward IV, ruler for most of 1461 to 1483, may have been illegitimate. If true, it would mean that Edward's younger brother, Georgeâ€”from whom Hastings is directly descendedâ€”should actually have assumed the throne, and Hastings would have eventually inherited the crown.

The pigs have been part of the landscape since the 1600s, when early settlers allowed them to roam; some escaped, though their numbers have long been relatively few and largely limited to the South. It's unclear what's behind the recent surge, but experts are working hard to find a way to contain them, Scientific American reports. Between the damage they cause and efforts to control them, wild pigs cost some $1.5 billion per year. In addition to eating crops, they can ruin fields by digging, threaten local species, and contaminate streams with their feces. I've never seen any one species that can affect so many livelihoods and resources, says a Texas official. The federal government is directing $20 million toward thinning their ranks. The USDA program involves destroying the wild pig population in two states every few years, starting with the states that have the fewest pigs. Among techniques for doing so are trapping, shooting pigs from helicopters, and sending a radio-collared Judas pig to reveal the whereabouts of his group. Meanwhile, some experts are calling for poisoning the animals. In addition to the government program, locals are taking on the task: A church recently sought crossbow hunters to protect pumpkins in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reports, while a hunter in Nebraska recently killed a 400-pound pig; the Omaha World-Herald has a rather alarming picture.

Now police have allegedly caught one of those women, 44-year-old Xeukun Su of China, and accused her of approaching two different victims over the spring and summer and running off with $160,000.

A new study out of Australia finds that women are more likely to find a man desirable if he's already had one or two partners, the country's ABC News reports. There appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner, say the authorsâ€”amusingly, their study, published in Human Nature, is titled I Want What She's Having. The phenomenon is known as mate copying, and researchers already knew animals practiced it, but wanted to see if it played a role in human mate selection. A man seeking a mate can get a lot of the information he needs just by observing his potential mate, but ... females are not as superficial as males, the lead author explains. They need to assess things like whether their partner will be a good parent or whether he'll stay committed; that's likely why they look for a male who's already been road-tested by other females and is thus more likely to have these desirable traits. But don't take it too far, guys: The researchers asked 123 women to rate the desirability of men using photos that noted the number of relationships they've racked up in four years, and when you go to five, the guy becomes really undesirable.

Between the beginning of 2016 and the end of October 2017, a 60 Minutes investigation uncovered more than 100 serious mechanical incidents the airline experienced: from hydraulic leaks and air pressure loss in the cabin to rapid descents, aborted takeoffs, and moreâ€”including 60 unscheduled landings. The airline has just 99 planes, yet experienced 25 engine failures or malfunctions in two years, and its planes are three and a half times more likely than those of other carriers to experience serious in-flight mechanical failures, per the report. But Allegiant Air, a budget carrier based in Las Vegas, is one of the most profitable airlines in the US, even if most customers are unaware of those problems. A former member of the National Transportation Safety Board says he won't fly the airline and encourages his family and friends not to fly it, either. The aviation experts 60 Minutes spoke to during its 7-month investigation believe the problems stem from Allegiant's ultra-low-cost fares; in order to keep them so affordable, the airline must keep its own costs downâ€”and keep its planes flying as long as possible. Almost 30% of its planes are McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s, which are old and difficult to find parts for. Those planes, nearly all of which were bought secondhand from foreign airlines, are responsible for most of the problems the investigation uncovered.

It's another thing entirely to win a game you've never played before. Christian Pham of St. Paul, Minn., did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons. By accident. The 40-year-old professional poker player says he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold 'em but inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in. It's a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies, says a dealer. Essentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it's better if it's a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards. Pham says he didn't realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what. At first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good, says Chris Mecklin, who was sitting next to Pham when the newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn't know it would be a fortuitous one.

Fifty-five girls between the ages of 3 and 5 were shown three figures, identical except that one was thin, one average, and one fat. When asked to associate positive and negative adjectives with each figure, the girls assigned an average of 3.1 negative and 1.2 positive words to the fat figures, but only 1.2 negative and 2.7 positive words to the thin ones. The girls were also more likely to choose the thin figure when asked who they would want to play with or have as a best friend. And when it came time to play a board game, some of the girls were so reluctant to play as the fat character that they wouldn't even touch the figure when asked to switchâ€”some even said things like, I hate her, she has a fat stomach.

There are plenty of progressives who are hungry for major change but may harbor lingering concerns about a messenger as divisive as Mr. Sanders, they write, and many more moderate Democratic primary voters see Warren as someone who speaks to their concerns about inequality and corruption.

It was at that point, however, that an officer's dash cam caught police beating Warren as he lay on the ground. Though he's now serving 20 years for attempted murder, Warren chose to sue, accusing five Birmingham cops of excessive force, Reuters reports. A settlement in the case was reached last month and the city gave it the thumbs up this week: Warren will receive $1,000 in nominal damages, while his lawyers will get $100,000 for expenses and $359,000 in fees.

The video shows officers hitting Warren for less than 10 seconds after he had hit a school bus, a police car, and the officer, who was setting up a spike strip during the chase.

The Verge reports scientists from Washington University in St. Louis have created a new map of the human brain that includes 97 areas never before identified. They published their findings Wednesday in Nature. A professor at Yale calls the new mapâ€”which Wired says sort of looks like a page from an adult coloring book â€”a huge leap in neuroscience. The map gives new detail to the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for motion, senses, emotions, and problem solving. Scientists hope it will help clarify how different parts of the brain impact human behavior, Popular Science reports. For example, researchers could use the map to find what areas are different between the brains of people with and without learning disabilities. Scientists created the new map by combining three different imaging techniques used on the brains of 210 young adults. No one's done this across the whole human brain, the study's author, Matt Glasser, tells Wired. The result is a map of 180 cortical areas in each of the brain's hemispheresâ€”more than half of them completely new. In fact, they're not even sure what some of them do. For example, one cortical area is activated by relaxing but deactivated by math problems for some reason.

After a technician determined there was a problem with the modem Dorff used to access the AOL service, the elderly man says he was told AT&T would not adjust the massive bill, according to Lazarus, who says the company waived the charges after he stepped in. A spokesman says Dorff's modem had somehow started calling a long-distance number when it accessed AOL, racking up hefty charges for every minute he was online. Whatever the issue was, Lazarus thinks AT&T could have done a lot better. I don't care if Dorff was making daily calls to the International Space Station, he writes. The simple fact is that AT&T allowed a customer's bill to become so over the top as to be laughable, then dug in its heels when the customerâ€”who lives off Social Security checksâ€”tried to deal with it. He adds that he was surprised to discover that Dorff is one of 2.2 million people still using AOL dial-up service.

Anti-government groups aligned with the patriot or militia movements are also exploding: There were 1,274 in operation last year, a stunning increase from 824 the year prior. The anti-government organizations represent both a kind of right-wing populist rage and a left-wing populist rage that has gotten all mixed up in anger toward the government, says the report's author.

A statement from pipeline owner TC Energy says that about 383,000 gallons of crude oilâ€”the equivalent of half an Olympic-size swimming pool, notes the Washington Postâ€”have saturated half an acre near the Canadian border, a few miles from the town of Edinburg. The somewhat good news: No people or wildlife have been reported injured, per a TC Energy statement, and because no one lives right near this section of wetland, which isn't a source of drinking water, a risk to public health isn't a concern at the moment, says a rep from the state's Department of Environmental Quality.

Monday's announcement comes days after Japan submitted its final plan to the International Whaling Commission after the commission's scientific committee said earlier this year it wasn't convinced that whales needed to be killed for research on whale stock management and conservation. Japan says lethal sampling is indispensable to obtain data on the maturing ages of whales. The IWC imposed a commercial ban on whaling in 1986, but Japan has continued to kill whales under a research exemption. This will be the first expedition since the International Court of Justice ruled last year that they weren't truly scientific, forcing Tokyo to revise its Antarctic whaling plans. Last year, Japan did go to the Antarctic, but didn't kill any whales. Japan's actual catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat; protests by anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd have also contributed. Tokyo plans to catch up to 333 minke whales each year over the next 12 years, about one-third of what it used to, the Fisheries Agency and the Foreign Ministry said Monday. The plan will be evaluated after six years.

After a technician determined there was a problem with the modem Dorff used to access the AOL service, the elderly man says he was told AT&T would not adjust the massive bill, according to Lazarus, who says the company waived the charges after he stepped in. A spokesman says Dorff's modem had somehow started calling a long-distance number when it accessed AOL, racking up hefty charges for every minute he was online. Whatever the issue was, Lazarus thinks AT&T could have done a lot better. I don't care if Dorff was making daily calls to the International Space Station, he writes. The simple fact is that AT&T allowed a customer's bill to become so over the top as to be laughable, then dug in its heels when the customerâ€”who lives off Social Security checksâ€”tried to deal with it. He adds that he was surprised to discover that Dorff is one of 2.2 million people still using AOL dial-up service.

The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, Reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the Hadean, after Hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the New Scientist notes. The UCLA and Stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on Earth may have formed almost instantaneously â€”and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point. The early Earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that, study co-author Mark Harrison says in a UCLA press release.

Reuters notes that's only phase one, however, in Edwin Hardeman's case, with the cause of his cancer kept separate from potential liability by Bayer AG, which acquired Monsanto, the weed killer's maker, last year. The unanimous decision handed down this week by a federal court said Roundup was a substantial factor in Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, moving the case into liability phase, where Hardeman's legal team will argue that Monsanto misled the public on glyphosate's health risks and should be held responsible, per the New York Times. We feel confident ... a jury ... will see that Monsanto has committed 40 years of corporate malfeasance, a Hardeman attorney says. This decision comes on the heels of last August's ruling that Monsanto must pay Dewayne Johnson $289 million, finding the weed killer contributed to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; per Reuters, that amount has since been reduced to $78 million and the case is in appeals. Bolstering Bayer's argument is the fact that regulators such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency have ruled glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen, though the World Health Organization disagrees and says it probably is.

Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus time served before trial. The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between an instructor and student.

Pamela Smart, who was 22 when her husband was killed, was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. Smart was one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program when she first seduced him when he was 15; Flynn testified that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband.

It all started on I-10 near New Orleans, where a 50-year-old man was driving the Chevy with his girlfriend's son in the back.

Jackson flings a cigarette out the vehicle, a police sergeant tells WWL, and the butt apparently hit the truck, which police say proceeded to cut Jackson off. And [Jackson] gets mad at that point. The two drivers kept cutting each other off until Jackson opened fire from the middle lane, according to a police report. The Chevy driver then rammed Jackson and followed him to an intersection where he rammed him again, and police made their arrest. I already knew my son had been shot, there was no way I was letting him go, the Chevy driver said, according to the sergeant.

At age 16, Ivins Rosier confessed to breaking into the home of Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody in West Palm Beach and shooting the 5-year-old German Shepherd, the newspaper noted in May. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective hustled the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the murder of a law enforcement officer (which wasn't legally true). Rosier's attorney also wanted his client sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of 6 years, CBS 12 reports. I believe this to be sadistic to do this to a child, said Rosier's attorney, who plans to appeal. He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious, but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile. Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand, said the prosecuting attorney. He's not a child.

Funny how that notion took holdâ€”that we use a tenth of our brain at any given timeâ€”because there's no actual evidence for it, the Conversation reports. The idea may date back to psychologist William James, who wrote in 1907 that we use only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources, and a foreword to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People that loosely quoted James as saying that the average person develops only 10% of his latent mental ability. Now, products exist to unlock the other 90% and a new thriller, Lucy, shows Scarlett Johansson taking drugs that enable her to use all 100% of her brain. But, as the Atlantic reports, scientists point out that the brain is an organ packed with living neurons that are always up to something. Brain scans that show only a small active portion of gray matter lighting up may confuse people, one neuroscience professor points out, because they show only the brain's major activities, not all of them. Yet those kinds of ideas self-perpetuate, he says. One possible basis for the 10% notion: The brain has almost 100 billion neurons, which are outnumbered roughly 10:1 by glial cells that keep the brain working.

The pigs have been part of the landscape since the 1600s, when early settlers allowed them to roam; some escaped, though their numbers have long been relatively few and largely limited to the South. It's unclear what's behind the recent surge, but experts are working hard to find a way to contain them, Scientific American reports. Between the damage they cause and efforts to control them, wild pigs cost some $1.5 billion per year. In addition to eating crops, they can ruin fields by digging, threaten local species, and contaminate streams with their feces. I've never seen any one species that can affect so many livelihoods and resources, says a Texas official. The federal government is directing $20 million toward thinning their ranks. The USDA program involves destroying the wild pig population in two states every few years, starting with the states that have the fewest pigs. Among techniques for doing so are trapping, shooting pigs from helicopters, and sending a radio-collared Judas pig to reveal the whereabouts of his group. Meanwhile, some experts are calling for poisoning the animals.

He was at a dock in Maryland Wednesday evening when he heard a mayday call, grabbed a crew, and rescued 22 people, including 14 children, whose boat had sunk in a remote area about 35 minutes north of him, WBAL reports. The school group's boat went down after hitting a submerged object in a restricted area around Bloodsworth Island, which the Navy used as a bombing range for more than 50 years. Shockley arrived to find the shivering group on the sunken boat's canopy, more than half a mile from shore. He managed to squeeze them all on his boat and get them to safety, where some of them required medical attention. Shockley tells the Washington Post that he thought he would be rescuing a fishing party of two or three people. I just couldn't imagine it. Seeing children sit on top of the boat like that, the waterman says, adding that the tide runs hard in that area and the situation could have easily been a disaster. Police say it was very lucky that Shockley was nearbyâ€”and that everybody was wearing life preservers. A spokesman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says Shockley will be awarded a citation for averting what could have been a terrible tragedy, the Baltimore Sun reports.

Both captured in Tunisia in May 1943, they gained momentary notoriety when, moved to act in part by news that Schymalla's 60-year-old father had been conscripted to join the withering Nazi forces, they managed to escape by boat. Having dug their way under a wire fence just before midnight on a Saturday in late October, they set off from Algona-Branch Camp No. 4 near Bena, Minn. Their plan: Follow Lake Winnibigoshish to the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where they hoped to catch a ride home, reports the Minneapolis Star Tribune. They had a head start in their journey thanks to the lack of a Sunday-morning count; the search began more than 24 hours after their escape. In a 1994 article for Minnesota History magazine, historian George Lobdell wrote that having been in the state since February, the men knew they needn't fear wild animals or Indians. Unfortunately, the three small maps they found in a dictionary apparently gave no understanding of the distances involved (as evidenced by the great number of things they packed, including shoe polish and a cigarette-rolling machine). They made it 20-odd miles south in the first few days, then hit a snowstorm and ultimately took a wrong turn into Jay Gould Lake on Friday. There they were spotted by a resort owner who called the county sheriff, and they were ultimately caught hiding in bushes. Their punishment: 30 days in confinement.

Never fear: There's apparently a pretty good chance one or more of your adult children will move back in with you at some point. A Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data finds that last year, 36.4% of women from age 18 to age 34 lived with their parents or relatives. That's the highest number since at least 1940, when 36.2% such women lived with family, the AP reports. (Less newsworthy is the fact that 42.8% of young men lived with parents or relatives last yearâ€”historically, more young men have lived with family than young women, the AP explains, and 42.8% is well below the 47.5% of young men who lived with family in 1940. The percentage of young people living with family fell after the 1940s in part because marriage rates increased and the workforce expanded; more women also joined the workforce. At the time, the median age of marriage for women was 21.5. Nowadays, it's 27, which is part of the reason more adult women are living with their parents: They're half as likely to be married as women of the same age were in 1940, but are more likely to have a college education, a Pew senior economist explains. There's also the fact that they're facing student debt and a higher cost of living these days. As for men, their median age of marriage was 24.3 in 1940 and is 29.3 now.

University of Central Missouri mathematician Curtis Cooper has discovered the biggest prime number yet, a 17 million-digit behemoth, as part of GIMPS. The project uses a huge network of volunteer computers as part of the search for Mersenne primes, a rare type of prime number first noted in the 17th century. The numberâ€”2 raised to the power of 57,885,161 minus 1â€”is more than 4 million digits longer than the previous record holder, which was found in 2008, LiveScience adds.

The simple, speedy theft is the biggest jewelry heist in years. Police had previously said yesterday's theft at the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel netted $53 million worth of treasureâ€”even at that level a major haul. Philippe Vique, an assistant prosecutor, said the Dubai-based organizer of the diamond show had since raised the value based on a more complete inventory. Vique described a canny, but quick and logistically simple, break-in. The suspect somehow got in through the hotel's locked French doors, which open onto Cannes' famed Croisette promenade, then held up the participants of the show with a handgun and fled on foot. The hold-up itself took about a minute, all with three private security guards, two vendors, and a manager of the sale-exhibit on hand.

Ciudad Real's Central airport, about 150 miles south of Madrid, became a symbol of the country's wasteful spending during a construction boom that ended with the financial crisis of 2008, the year the airport opened.

After taking a moment to smack Newsweek for the cheap sensationalism of its buzzy cover, Loewen imparts a history lesson. Buchanan was gay, before, during and after his four years in the White House, he writes for Salon. And the country was well aware of it. (Not convinced? Consider this line from an 1844 letter Buchanan wrote: I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.

The woman (impregnated via rape, a friend says) demanded an abortion at eight weeks' pregnancy and said she was suicidal, but a medical panel turned her down. When she threatened the hunger strike, health authorities obtained court approval to have her baby delivered prematurely at 25 weeks. The newborn has been placed in care, the Guardian says, and officials tell the Irish Times that they've launched an internal review. It's become a test case for Ireland's new abortion law. The 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act allows for abortions in certain casesâ€”like a suicidal woman impregnated by rape or incest, or a woman's life being at riskâ€”despite a constitutional amendment that protects fetuses from inception. Now critics say the law is pointless, because suicidal women will struggle to persuade a panel of up to seven experts.

Apparently the retailer had only one to sell, and it's now sold out; the sweatshirt then appeared on eBay with a starting bid of $550, but that auction ended with no bids. According to a screenshot from BuzzFeed, Urban Outfitters seemed to be hawking the $129 sweatshirt as an actual vintage piece; the description included the line, Vintage Finds are handpicked vintage pieces from allover [sic] the map, though the description didn't appear to say anything about blood, real or fake. Kent State condemned the retailer's move, Fox News reports, saying in a statement: We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit.

Keelin O'Neill, who inherited the stamp several years ago from his grandfather, turned it over at the World Stamp Show in New York to the American Philatelic Research Library and collected a $50,000 reward in the process. But the mystery surrounding the Inverted Jenny remains: Who stole it and three other such stamps at a 1955 convention in Virginia? Two of the other stamps were recovered years ago, and the fourth remains missing. I had no idea about the history and importance of the stamp until very recently, says O'Neill. I have to say, it's quite fascinating, and I'm excited to learn more. A hundred Inverted Jenny stamps were printed in 1918, until someone noticed the error. The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va. The stamps disappeared from a display case there, and it's been a whodunit ever since. Two were recovered in 1977 and 1982 from Chicago connoisseurs who had bought them.

The plan will be presented at the UNÂ today and will be on the agenda at the critical climate change summit in Copenhagen this December. Beyond the emissions promise, the airlines are pledging 100% carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and entry into a global carbon trading scheme by next year. The aviation industry was exempted from carbon caps at the 1997 Kyoto conference, and today's plans are being seen as an attempt to avoid rebukes from environmental campaigners in Copenhagen. Willie Walsh, the British Airways CEOÂ making today's announcement, called the proposals the most environmentally effective and practical means of reducing aviation's carbon impact.

On its Facebook page, the Lort Smith Animal Hospital explains how Dr. Tristan Rich knocked George out by putting him in a bucket of anesthetic-laced water, removed the tumor, and then sealed the wound with sutures and tissue glue. The 10-year-old fish is now swimming around again and could live for another 20 years, the animal hospital says.

Cheetahs are a vulnerable species, with only 7,500 left in the wild. They also have low genetic diversity owing to a mass die-off about 10,000 years ago. That's made breeding cheetahs in captivity rather difficult. Indeed, there hasn't been a successful birth through artificial insemination since 2003, reports Smithsonian. That's why biologists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute opted to try IVF. And third time's the charm: After fertilizing eggs retrieved from a genetically valuable 6.5-year-old female at the Columbus Zoo with sperm from a male cheetah at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas, who proved a good genetic match, the eggs were successfully implanted in a 3-year-old surrogate, also at the Columbus Zoo, whose genetic line is overrepresented. The cubsâ€”a male and a female who are nursing, per USA Todayâ€”were born Wednesday, about 90 days later, in a bit of a surprise. Usually it takes many, many, many tries of a technique like this before it's successful, SCBI biologist Adrienne Crosier tells Smithsonian. This is a really big breakthrough for us ... where we can reproduce these individuals that are unable or unwilling to breed naturally to maximize genetic health, she says, noting the donor female has yet to give birth and was unlikely to breed on her own. A third of cheetahs in captivity are unable to breed due to factors such as age, health, and behavior, per CNN. Yet this is the science that could save that species in the wild, says Suzi Rapp of the Columbus Zoo. And perhaps not only cheetahs.

And at least one archeologist believes he knows what it holds. Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted, Nicholas Reeves said at a news conference on Saturday. I think it is Nefertiti, and all the evidence points in that direction. The tomb of Queen Nefertiti has never definitively been found, and Reeves believes King Tut was actually buried in her tomb because his wasn't ready, with her being shunted off to a side room, according to the BBC. He came up with his theory while analyzing detailed scans of King Tut's tomb used to create a replica for tourists. He claims those scans revealed two doorways that were covered up. Infrared scans made earlier this month seemed to support Reeves' theory, showing differing heat patterns along the walls of the tomb, AFP reports. According to the BBC, Egypt's Antiquities ministry did further scans to test the theory over the past few weeks, leading to Saturday's 90% estimate. The scans are being sent to Japan for further analysis. And while experts are now fairly convinced Reeves was right about the hidden chamber, the question of whoâ€”if anyoneâ€”is inside is still being debated.

The newly disclosed figures, cited in internal budget documents, are significantly higher than the few hundred illegal immigrants the Obama administration acknowledged this week had been released under the budget-savings process. The states where immigrants were released include Arizona, California, Georgia, and Texas. The government documents show that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field offices reported more than 2,000 immigrants released before intense criticism this week led to a temporary shutdown of the plan. The White House has said it was not consulted about the releases, and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has acknowledged they occurred in a manner she regrets.

On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeletonâ€”with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered by accident. Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more: This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australiaâ€”albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was hereâ€”so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.

A budding lawyer, Lincoln won a case before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841 that released Nance Legins-Costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-Costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, William Henry Costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central Illinois hometown of Pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by Lincoln? An amateur historian named Carl Adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about Legins-Costley last year, Nance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincolnâ€”A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley. The editor of a history journal says Nance tells the only story of Lincoln that is really new, according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from Illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in Galveston, Texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; Costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, Costley moved to Minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in Rochester. There, Adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as Costley's.

It's the latest effort by geologists to pinpoint exactly when our current historical era began. We're still officially in the Holocene Epoch, reports the BBC, which started nearly 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, but the Anthropocene has been proposed as a new era humans set in motion far more recently. Some say this era began as recently as 1964, the point at which the first nuclear tests were banned. Others date it back a century further to the Industrial Revolution. But in the journal Nature, a new proposal suggests that 1610 is the precise start date thanks to the major global impact of the European population on the Americasâ€”from farming and trade to the spread of disease that resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million people, many of whom were farmers. When that farmland returned to its original vegetation, that growth removed enough carbon from the atmosphere to see a pronounced dip in the global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration that can be seen in ice core records, one scientist said.

Suspect Nakwon Foxworth, 33, who was with his pregnant girlfriend Jessica Hickling and their 4-month-old son, became angry at movers who were blocking the entrance with a barrel late Saturday night, the New York Daily News reports. He took the stroller, with the baby in it, and started ramming it into the barrel, one of the movers says, adding that Foxworth then pulled a gunâ€”which he ultimately threw into the child's stroller.

As police were preparing for a standoff, Hickling managed to escape the apartment with her son around 12:30am. Foxworth quickly started shooting through the open door, just 10 feet away from police; officers later found a cache of illegal guns and ammo in his apartment.

The ring took babies from hundreds of poor or unwed mothers dating back to the 1980s and sold them into adoption, say officials. Sister Maria Gomez Valbuena, the first person to be arrested in the operation, has been charged with snatching a newborn from a young mom in Madrid in 1982. When the mother demanded to know where her baby was, the nun told me: â€˜Stop asking me that or else I will also take away your other daughter and you will go to jail for adultery,' said the mom, who has been reunited with her 29-year-old daughter. Valbuena appeared before a judge yesterday and refused to testify, reports the New York Daily News. Police have received hundred of complaints of baby snatchings, which have been widely investigated by the media. Catholic priests and nuns served as middlemen in the operations that also involved doctors, nurses, lawyers, and scores of clinics and hospitals, according to police investigators.

According to a professor of microbiology at Birmingham, England's Aston University, the answer is ... it depends on whether you're in your bedroom or kitchen. Anthony Hilton and his biology students looked at two types of bacteria (E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus) on three flooring options: carpet, laminate, tile. Toast, pasta, a cookie, and a sticky sweet were dropped on the various surfaces and rested there for 3 to 30 seconds. When it came to the transfer of bacteria, both time and flooring type played a role. Bacteria were least likely to hop aboard the fallen bite if carpet was involved; when moist foods hit laminate and tiled surfaces, bacteria was more likely to transfer when contact was made for more than 5 seconds. The upshot, per Hilton: We have found evidence that transfer from indoor flooring surfaces is incredibly poor. That's likely welcome news to the 87% of people the students surveyed who reported a willingness to adhere to the five-second rule. Writing for Forbes, Alice Walton notes that the findings should be taken with a grain of saltâ€”preferably one not dropped on the floor.

Most recently, 74-year-old Tsuwa Suzuki was found dead in the Akita prefecture this weekend in an attack so severe that authorities could barely identify her. She was apparently killed while picking edible plants in a mountain forest. Three men, one in his sixties and two in their seventies, were also killed in the same area in separate incidents while picking bamboo shoots. Authorities responded to Suzuki's death by sending out a search team and fatally shooting a 4-foot-high, 154-pound female Asiatic black bear just 20 yards from where the woman was killed, Asahi Shimbun reports. Local vet Takeshi Komatsu says there may be only one perpetrator behind the maulings. After tasting human flesh (for the first time), the bear may have realised that it can eat them, Komatsu says. Yet sightings of black Asiatic bears and brown bears have soared in northern Japan this year, surpassing 1,200, which already doubles last year's count. An unusually high crop of beechnuts may have boosted the bear population by improving the nutrition of mother bears, Yomiuri Shimbun reports. Meanwhile, authorities are advising people to take precautions when walking around the mountains. Bears normally avoid humans, so it's good to make them aware of your presence by using something like a bell, says a member of a nonprofit that specializes in driving away bears.",Severe' Bear Attacks Kill ____ in Japan,Copy(4),4

There's a business opportunity in Brooklyn, and all you have to do is chow down 30 pounds of meat, rice, cheese, and various salsas to take part. Don Chingon, a recently opened Mexican restaurant in Park Slope, is offering a 10% ownership stake in the eatery if you can complete the Gran Chingon Challenge, the Daily Meal reports. You simply have to pay the $150 entry fee and consume the eponymous huge badass burritoâ€”which New York Daily News reporter Gersh Kuntzman describes as looking like a large toddler â€¦ or a small coffin â€”in one hour. If you are going to eat a massive amount of food and gain 25-30 [pounds] in a single sitting, you deserve real compensation, the Chingon team tells Food & Wine. Some restaurants will put your name on the wall. We'll just give you the wall. The clock starts as soon as you touch the burritoâ€”which the owner says contains about 25,000 caloriesâ€”and competitors are disqualified if they take any bathroom breaks or there's discharge [of] bodily fluids of any kind (including running noses or eyes), Food & Wine notes; the eatery also says it isn't responsible if contenders get sick or die. Owner Victor Robey, who tells the Park Slope Stoop that he was inspired by shows like the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, suggests downing the mandatory ghost pepper margarita at the end, noting the pepper is like the cherry on top. If you're in the area and try (and likely fail) this challenge, don't feel too bad: Renowned eating champ Joey Chestnut broke the world burrito-eating record in May, and even he could scarf down just 14 poundsâ€”though he was given only 10 minutes, per KUSA.

Some 65 years ago, a group of Germans who had fought with the Nazi-era Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS amassed an army. The revelation surfaced by way of a 321-page file unearthed by accident in the archives of the country's foreign intelligence agency (a historian hired by the BND to dig into the agency's origins found the documents, titled insurances, while trying to figure out how many employees the BND originally had). What Agilolf Kesselring found instead was details on the 1949 forming of a secretâ€”and, under Allied law, illegalâ€”army by some 2,000 ex-officers, who intended to protect West Germany against the Soviets or Eastern European countries; a study on the documents was published this week. Der Spiegel notes that the file is incomplete and thus needs to be considered with some restraint, but reports on what the document does reveal: That if an attack was launched from the East, 40,000 fighters would protect the countryâ€”whose own chancellor didn't even learn the group existed until 1951, and apparently made no moves to dissolve it. Der Spiegel explains in detail the involvement of Albert Schnez, a WWII colonel who was instrumental in founding the group, seeking funds from like-minded citizens, making contact with veterans groups, asking for help from the West German secret service (which gave it a small amount of money through 1953), and crafting an emergency plan that involved potentially making use of transportation company vehicles and police weapons in case of emergency.

Little did Chauncy know that he was about to change his life. He told White that he had taken a bus to the rich people's Kroger in the hope of getting some food, since his own fridge was empty. He looked ashamed, hungry, and broken, White writes on Facebook. So instead of buying him doughnuts, I went on a shopping spree for cereal, pizza, milk, soap, toothbrushes, and more. But when he drove the boy home with the haul, he discovered Chauncy and his disabled mother were truly living with nothing, he writes, per Fox 13. They didn't even have beds or furniture. They were sleeping on pads made out of sleeping bags, they had two lamps and nothing in their fridge. White decided to help the family even further. Chauncy is a straight A student who is doing his best to make it in a world with no money and very few resources. He wants to work and help his mother financially, he writes on a GoFundMe page he set up to raise $250 so Chauncy could buy a lawn mower and start mowing lawns for money.

LaHaye died in a San Diego hospital days after having suffered a stroke, according to his publicist Johnnie Moore. Co-authored with Jerry B. Jenkins, the 16-volume Left Behind series sold more than 80 million copies worldwide, Moore said, and popularized a Bible interpretation that said born-again Christians will be instantly taken to God in the rapture, while those left behind on earth endure seven years of tribulation. LaHaye was a key figure in conservative political groups, encouraging the Rev. Jerry Falwell to create the Moral Majority and forming the Council for National Policy, a secretive strategy group for prominent political and religious conservatives. Along with his wife, Beverly, he started Concerned Women for America in 1979, as an alternative to liberal feminist organizations. LaHaye was also a prolific nonfiction writer, writing more than 60 additional books, including the Christian sex manual The Act of Marriage. Born in 1926, LaHaye had a hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, served in the Air Force at the end of World War II and graduated from Bob Jones University. He earned a midcareer doctorate at Western Seminary in Portland, Ore., and joined the Southern Baptist Convention. LaHaye extended his influence by founding Christian high schools, San Diego Christian College, known formerly as Christian Heritage College, and a church in the Atlanta area, along with helping establish the Institute for Creation Research, which rejects evolution and contends God created the Earth recently in six literal days.",Left Behind Author Tim LaHaye Dead at ____,Copy(90),90

Kitson is in a contract dispute with Hudson Groupâ€”which operates dozens of stores at Los Angeles International Airport and hundreds more at airports across the countryâ€”and is suing Hudson for gouging passengers with bottled water that costs nearly $5, NBC News reports. A Kitson lawyer tells the AP that Hudson, which operates two stores at LAX for Kitson, is taking advantage of the post-9/11 airport restrictions and refused to sell liter bottles of water for $2.55 at the Kitson stores it operates because it was making too much money selling water at higher prices elsewhere. According to airport authority rules, products sold in LAX terminals cannot be priced more than 18% above their street value, NBC notes. With $5 water, I don't know what street that is, but that's not my street, a Kitson spokeswoman tells Forbes. Hudson, which accuses Kitson of angling to get its own airport retail space, counters that Kitson only started trying to sell water after it was accused of breach of contract when its founder turned up at the airport stores to berate employees.

It was at that point, however, that an officer's dash cam caught police beating Warren as he lay on the ground. Though he's now serving 20 years for attempted murder, Warren chose to sue, accusing five Birmingham cops of excessive force, Reuters reports. A settlement in the case was reached last month and the city gave it the thumbs up this week: Warren will receive $1,000 in nominal damages, while his lawyers will get $100,000 for expenses and $359,000 in fees. The settlement was reached in part to save taxpayer dollars, the officers' lawyer tells AL.com. The video shows officers hitting Warren for less than 10 seconds after he had hit a school bus, a police car, and the officer, who was setting up a spike strip during the chase. The lawyer explains that Warren got just $1,000 because the city was able to show his injuries stemmed from his car crash, not police brutality. Warren claimed the opposite.

A school resource officer at Sidney Lanier Middle School learned of that post and others, and after interviewing students and seeking to obtain the IP address associated with the Instagram account, determined the 12-year-old Lanier student made the posts.

The wombs are not connected to the women's fallopian tubes, so they still can't get pregnant the old-fashioned way, but they've had embryos created from their own eggs via in-vitro fertilization. Doctors will soon attempt to implant those embryos in their new uteri, the AP reports, and the wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies, so that the women can stop taking side-effect-ridden anti-rejection drugs.

Many of the injured have minor wounds, while others had broken bones and one woman rescued from the rubble was in critical but stable condition with head injuries. There was no warning in advance, said Mayor Bill de Blasio. Itâ€™s a tragedy of the worst kind because there was no indication. He promised to investigate claims by residents that they had smelled gas for days and called 311 many times; one neighbor tells the New York Post that gas smells persisted for years. The city says it will look into a contractor's installation of a new gas line in one of the buildings nine months ago. What's more, one of the buildings had several vertical cracks deemed dangerous in 2008, according to city records, but there's no record of them ever being fixed.","____ Dead, Over 50 Injured in Harlem Blast",Trans(three),3

Security cameras spotted violinist Phillip Johnson, then 27, lingering outside the room and Johnson's ex-girlfriend later said he had taken it. Without proof, Totenberg could only hope he would one day see his musical partner of 38 years again. His wish went unfulfilled: He died in 2012 at age 101 without knowing where his violinâ€”the Ames Stradivariusâ€”was. Today, it falls back into the hands of the Totenberg family at a ceremony in New York, reports the violinist's daughter and NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg. She says the FBI called her in June to say the violin had surfaced in a locked case left to Johnsonâ€™s ex-wife when he died of cancer in 2011. Appraiser Phillip Injeian, contacted by Johnson's ex-wife, doubted the Stradivarius' authenticity since just 550 are known to exist. Photos looked so remarkably good, however, that he arranged a meeting. After half an hour, I said these words, 'Well, I've got good news for you, and I've got bad news for you,' Injeian says. 'The good news is that this is a Stradivarius. The bad news it was stolen 35, 36 years ago from Roman Totenberg.' Injeian reported the discovery to FBI agents, who found its measurements precisely matched those of Totenberg's instrument, as did pearl on the tuning pegs. Nina Totenberg tells the New York Times the Strad, now likely worth millions, will be sold to another great artist who will play it in concert halls all over the world.

Law requires the agency to pay private air carriers above the market rate for shipments there, and the agency then charges retailers just half of the commercial shipping price. The results have hammered a struggling Postal Service: Thanks to the subsidies, the agency has lost $2.5 billion over 33 years, the Washington Post reports. Last year alone, the subsidies cost the USPS $77.5 million, officials say; the money comes from the Postal Service's customers. The subsidies benefit rural Alaskan businesses, but locals still pay high prices for goods. Retailers may mark up prices by as much as 30% or more, Lisa Rein writes in the Post. A pallet of drinks, for instance, cost the Postal Service $3,200 to send, but Alaska Commercial paid only $485 for the postage. Even so, a 12-pack of Coke from the shipment cost a family more than $15 at the Alaska Commercial store. It's all because of an earmark by former senator Ted Stevens to ensure delivery to remote Alaskaâ€”but that was 33 years ago, and these days the Postal Service's finances are dangerously tight. Still, legislative action is difficult, Rein explains: Lawmakers don't want to see distant areas of the country lose access to goods.

Democrats wonâ€™t likely support the 2012 plan, helmed by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan, but Republicans are betting Americans are concerned enough about the deficit that theyâ€™ll support vast cuts to a system that pays bills for many, the Journal notes. Under the plan, which would affect those now under 55, Medicare would become a premium support system. At 65, participants would select a private insurance plan, and the government would pay about the first $15,000 in premiums, with the poor and less healthy receiving heftier amounts. There is nobody saying that Medicare can stay in its current path, Ryan said. As it stands, the program is projected to cost $502.8 billion in 2016.

Former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz originally were charged with felonies. The reduced charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Penn State ex-President Graham Spanier was also charged; his prosecution appears to be moving forward, with jury selection set for next week. The three handled a 2001 complaint by a graduate assistant who said he saw Sandusky, a retired defensive football coach, sexually abusing a boy in a team shower. They did not report the matter to police or child welfare authorities, but barred Sandusky from bringing children to campus. Sandusky was not arrested until a decade later. He was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse of 10 boys, and is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison term. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest, Paterno was fired. Schultz and Curley were arrested in 2011, and Spanier in 2012. The three former administrators at Penn State had also faced conspiracy charges. Each felony count carried the possibility of seven years in prison. Their case has dragged on for years because of a dispute about their representation during a grand jury appearance by Penn State's then-chief counsel Cynthia Baldwin.

Instead, it praised them for selflessly serving the poor and asked the nuns themselves to assess their own challenges amid declining numbers, reports the Catholic News Service. The Vatican also promised to value their feminine genius more.

Tiger Woods got penalized two strokes before the start of the third round this morning after officials reviewed a drop he took on the 15th hole yesterday, reports ESPN. It's a huge penalty, putting Woods five shots back instead of three. And it comes a day after 14-year-old prodigy Guan Tianlang got tagged with a rare slow-play penalty that cost him a stroke. As for Tiger: His trouble started on the 15th when his third shot hit the flag and doinked into the water. He dropped a new ball, as he can do under the rules with a one-stroke penalty, and played on. The problem is that he was supposed to drop that ball as closely as possible to the original. And as he himself admitted afterward, I went back to where I played it from, but went two yards further back. (He didn't want to hit the flag again.) It might have been worse: The Masters could have disqualified him for signing what turned out to be an inaccurate scorecard.

Terry Branstad with nearly 17 million chickens and turkeys dead, dying, or scheduled to be euthanized due to a widening bird flu outbreak. The proclamation activates disaster response and recovery procedures for the state's homeland security and emergency management personnel. It authorizes use of state resources, supplies, equipment, and materials to track and monitor bird flu, establish restrictions around affected farms, and assist in the rapid detection of cases. It also allows state agencies to help in the disposal of poultry carcasses, an increasing problem in a state where about 27% of its 60 million egg-laying chickens will be wiped out. Reuters reported last week that this could be the worst bird flu outbreak in US history. This is a magnitude much greater than anything we've dealt with in recent modern times, Branstad said. Added Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey, Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone to slow the spread of the disease, outbreaks are continuing to appear. Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer, providing one of every five eggs consumed in the country. The state is ninth in turkey production and has lost well over 110,000 turkeys. The state now has 21 cases of the H5N2 virus in 10 counties. Overall, the outbreak has led to Midwest chicken and turkey producers losing more than 21 million birds.

Obviously, having not known for so long, I was exercising heaps, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol, and eating anything and everything, she says. I had absolutely no real clear symptoms, Hudson tells The Young Mummy blog. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn't nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain. (She was still a size 6 when she flew home, the Daily Mail reports.) It wasn't until just after she started her tripâ€”since her boyfriend wasn't coming along, she went off birth control while overseasâ€”that she stopped getting her period and started to suspect they'd gotten pregnant just before she left. Even after getting the positive pregnancy test, I wasn't showing at all and had no symptoms, she says. In fact, it wasn't until her flight home that she felt her baby kick for the first time. So how is this possible? Doctors told Hudson she had a tilted uterus and Mason was sitting high in her diaphragm, so it wasn't obvious that she was expecting. As WhatToExpect.com explains, a tilted or retroverted uterus leans backward toward your spine instead of forward toward your navel, and it can also sometimes mean that your doctor may have trouble finding your baby with a transabdominal ultrasound because the baby's a bit farther away from those trying to get a peek at him.

The episode, which the police chief in the town of Bourne calls crazy and hectic, left one woman dead, another woman and an officer wounded, and suspect Adrian Loya in custody. After attacking the women, whose connection to Loya is unclear, he set a vehicle on fire to block the only road into the condo complex and set up devices resembling bombs, authorities say. The state police bomb squad examined the devices and determined they were all fakes that contained no explosives. Officers made their way around the burning vehicle on foot and were pinned down by gunfire, the district attorney says. The wounded officer, shot in the back below his bulletproof vest, took cover between two vehicles, his colleagues unable to reach him for 15 minutes until the suspect was arrested. At a hearing yesterdayâ€”which was Loya's 31st birthdayâ€”he pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion, and assault and battery of a police officer. A judge ordered Loya, who is stationed in Chesapeake, Va., to be held without bail and to undergo a mental health examination.

In Hallman's case, he served from 1953 to 1955, stationed in Frankfurt, Germany. He was discharged in 1955 as a Class II homosexual following a military sting and was so scared of how that would paint him that he never mentioned his military service again, the New York Times reported in September.

Umit Dundar, the newly appointed acting chief of the general staff, said officers from the Air Force, the military police and the armored units, were mainly involved in the attempt. The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the military, and Turkey's main opposition parties quickly condemned the attempted overthrow of the government. Turkish Prime Minister Benali Yildirim said 161 people had been killed and 1,440 wounded in the overnight violence. He said 2,839 plotters had been detained. Yildirim described the night as dark stain for Turkish democracy and said the perpetrators will receive every punishment they deserve. Fighting continued into the early morning, with the sounds of huge blasts echoing across Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, including at least one bomb that hit the parliament complex.

Urban areas led the increase, with cities of between 500,000 and 1 million people seeing a 3.7% jump in rates; murder rates in those cities were up 12.5%, the New York Times reports. In the biggest cities, however, the increase was less pronounced. Cities of 1 million or more saw violent crime increase 1.4%, with murders up 1.5% and rapes 3.2%. New York City, however, saw murders fall some 20%, bringing the number to 419â€”the fewest in half a century, the Times notes. The 2012 increase comes after 2011 saw violent crime drop 3.8%.

Anytime you come on scene with something this horrific, [with] children involved, it's pretty unsettling, even to seasoned law enforcement and deputies, the Columbia County sheriff tells News4Jax. Ariel told police her brother beat her and locked her in a bedroom that evening. When he fell asleep, Nicole unlocked the door, and Ariel says they got a gun from their parents' bedroom and she shot him in the living room. The sisters then left their 3-year-old sister and walked more than 3 miles to a Dollar General in town, where police were called. The officer was very compassionate with the girls. We were mainly worried about their safety, says one detective, but Ariel soon confessed to the shooting, adds WFOX. Police learned their parents had left the children at home Monday and were three hours away when their son was shot. When they returned, police charged them with child neglect. Now the state attorney says he may be forced to actually charge [the sisters] as adults, adds the Gainesville Sun; the 3-year-old is now in state custody, notes the Florida Times-Union.

The Kennebec Journal digs into how those two facts came to be, and presents a picture of a man who wasn't the woodsman you might expect: He didn't hunt, fish, forage for food, or grow it.

Williams opened his first Williams-Sonoma store in Sonoma, Calif., in 1956 inspired by a trip to Paris three years earlier. A lover of cooking and entertaining, he wanted US professional chefs and home cooks to have access to high-quality cookware and tools. I couldn't get over seeing so many great things for cooking, the heavy pots and pans, white porcelain ovenware, country earthenware, great tools and professional knives, Williams told the Washington Post in 2005. He refurbished the store off Sonoma's town square, with custom shelving to display pots and pans and a simple logo with Williams and Sonoma in block letters over a woodcut pineappleâ€”a symbol of hospitality. The shop was such an enormous success that in 1958, he relocated to a 3,000-square-foot store in San Francisco.

Stitt was arrested when he failed a field sobriety test and charged with felony aggravated DUI, and Palatine police say he's being held on $75,000 bail and due back in court Dec. 15. As of late last night, he was still in custody. I obviously am disappointed and the family is disappointed, Caitlin's stepfather tells the Daily Herald. This stirs up a whole new set of feelings that had been kind of under the surface for quite some time. I feel bad for a lot of people. ... This is bad for his family just like it's bad for our family. If he's convicted, Stitt could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.

Soon after, there was another call: There is a car on top of another car, the second caller said. The people are stuck inside. Five people died in the crash, the Dayton Daily News reports. Among the dead in the suspected drunken driving accident was 61-year-old James Pohlabeln, the driver who was going the wrong way. The divorced retiree had been released from jail in connection with another suspected drunk driving crash just 33 hours earlier. Also killed were Kyle Canter, 23, Earl Miller II, 27, Devin Bachmann, 26â€”all members of local hard rock band Counterfluxâ€”and 29-year-old Vashti Nicole Brown. The four were in a SUV being driven by Canter, the night's designated driver, a Counterflux member tells ABC 22. A message on the Counterflux Facebook page calls the three men our lost brothers and urges people not to drink and drive. Your actions and choices affect more than just you, the post says. And though a totaled car can be replaced a life cannot. Police arrested Pohlabeln some 48 hours before the fatal collision after he crashed into two parked cars around 2:20am. He pleaded not guilty and was released from jail Thursday night. Pohlabeln was a very nice guy, but he had a drinking problem, a neighbor tells WHIO. He would be drinking and driving, pull up and his vehicle would be half parked, she says, recounting a time when she and her son had to carry a drunken Pohlabeln into his house after he stumbled out of his car and fell to the pavement.

The 71-year-old Shepard told a police officer that he had two tequila drinks and was planning to drive home, Santa Fe police Lt. Andrea Dobyns said yesterday. Our officer could smell alcohol on his breath, and he had bloodshot, watery eyes, she said. Shepard was arrested on a charge of aggravated driving while intoxicated outside La Choza restaurant in downtown. He was released from a Santa Fe jail yesterday afternoon after posting bail. The restaurant's security called police about 7:45pm Monday, concerned because a man was trying to leave in a pickup, but the vehicle's emergency brake was engaged. Shepherd declined to take a breath test, but he did perform a field sobriety test, which he failed, Dobyns said. The arrest appears to be Shepard's second on charges of drunken driving. In January 2009, he was arrested on charges of speeding and drunken driving in the central Illinois town of Normal. Shepard was driving 16mph over the 30mph speed limit, police said.

TRAIN_1258,"(Feb 10, 2015 8:58 AM) Lest we forget: The Equal Justice Initiative today released a report that documents 3,959 racial terror lynchings throughout 12 Southern states over the 1877 to 1950 period. That's at least 700 more lynchings of black people in these states than previously reported, reports the EJI in what it calls the most comprehensive work done on lynching to date, the result of four years of research. The New York Times reports that in 1882, the Chicago Tribune started annually publishing a list of the prior year's lynchings; the Tuskegee Institute and NAACP published lists in the early 20th century, and researchers in 1995 used all the existing documentation to create a master list. As for the 700 names that hadn't previously been recorded, one of those 1995 researchers, EM Beck, says that the definition of a lynching varies from list to list (the EJI's includes some one-time massacres of large numbers of African-Americans, per the Times). But if you're trying to make a point that the amount of racial violence is underestimated, well then, there's no doubt about it, says Beck. The report asserts the lynchings were a form of terrorism, writing they were not 'frontier justice' because they generally took place in communities where there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for African Americans. Further, racial terror lynching was ... a tactic for maintaining racial control, not merely punishment of an alleged perpetrator for an alleged crime. The report illustrates some of the social grievances men were lynched for: knocking on a white woman's door (General Lee, 1904, Reevesville, SC) and bumping into a white woman while running to catch a train (Jeff Brown, 1916, Cedar Bluff, Miss.). The EJI hopes to erect memorials or markers at some of the lynching sites; the Guardian reports few currently exist and notes that EJI Director Bryan Stevenson expects challenges in terms of securing funding and approval.",South's History of 'Racial Terror': ____ Newly Found Lynchings,Copy(700),700

The Guardian has a timeline of the law, which established homosexuality as a crime: Born in 1872, the law was embraced by Nazis some 50 years later; the New York Times reports 100,000 men were charged under the Nazis, with half ending up in prison and as many as 15,000 sent to concentration camps, where a pink triangle was affixed to their uniform. When the war ended, the law did not. More than 50,000 men were convicted under it between 1946 and 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized, and a few thousand more even after that in West Germany.

But while he's focused on giving his father a proper burial, police are looking for those responsible. Authorities are concentrating on former mob boss Francis Cadillac Frank Salemme, sources tell the Boston Globe. Stephen Flemmiâ€”who is serving a life sentence in connection with 10 murdersâ€”told police in 2003 that he walked in on DiSarro's murder at the home of Salemme's ex-wife on May 10, 1993, according to a DEA report. Flemmi said Salemme watched as his son Francis Jr.â€”an assistant manager at DiSarro's nightclub, per the APâ€”strangled DiSarro, who reportedly borrowed money from the mob to reopen the Channel Nightclub, per the Boston Herald and WCVB. Flemmi said Salemme later told him he helped hide DiSarro's body at a Rhode Island construction site and that mobster Robert DeLuca was present during the burial. DeLuca was reportedly close to alleged mob associate William Ricci, who owns the complex behind which DiSarro's body was found. Francis Jr. died in 1995. A lawyer for Francis Sr.â€”who is in the Witness Protection Program for aiding the prosecution of James Whitey Bulgerâ€”says his client absolutely denies any involvement in Steve DiSarro's murder and Flemmi's version of events never happened, pure and simple.

She visited five specialists and had three surgeries over the years, all to no availâ€”until doctors at Loyola University's health system figured out the problem, reports ABC News.

My patients typically come in carrying a thick folder of medical records because they have tried for a long time to find a cure for their illness, says the doctor who successfully treated Campbell. Most feel constant fatigue and facial pain and have had recurring bouts of sinusitis. Once the diagnosis was made, doctors surgically removed the polyps, opened up Campbell's nasal passages, desensitized her to aspirin, and weaned her off the steroid medications she'd been taking for years. Result? I woke up and could smell breakfast and could taste coffee, says Campbell.

When that percentage is applied to the overall US population, it works out to an estimated 4.2 million adults. The frequency breakdown among those who copped to driving while under the influence: 58% said they did it once in the last 30 days; 23% said twice; 17% said 3â€“10; and 0.8% said daily. That works out to an estimated 121 million episodes per year, the study says. And the admitted part is key: Experts say the figure is likely low since some offenders may not have confessed and drivers under 18 were left out. The worst offenders? Young men. Males in general were involved in 80% of cases, but those 21-34 had a role in 32% of offenses, though that gender and age group makes up just 11% of the population, report NBC News and LiveScience. Hawaii had the highest per-capita rate with 995 alcohol-impaired driving episodes annually per 1,000 people.

The avalanches buried homes across four northeast provinces, killing those beneath, says Mohammad Aslam Syas, the deputy director of the Afghanistan Natural Disaster Management Authority. The province worst hit appeared to be Panjshir province, about 60 miles northeast of the capital, Kabul, where the avalanches destroyed or damaged around 100 homes, Syas says. The acting governor of Panjshir, Abdul Rahman Kabiri, says rescuers used their bare hands and shovels in an effort to reach survivors. Rescue teams had been dispatched to the affected areas and casualties were expected to rise, Syas says. Large parts of Afghanistan have been covered in snow as a major storm interrupted an otherwise mild and dry winter. Natural disasters such as landslides, floods, and avalanches have taken a toll on a country with little infrastructure outside of its major cities.

The S&P 500 also broke records this morning, rising six points (0.3%) to 2,084. This followed on the heels of news that the US economy grew at a sizzling 5% annual rate in the July-September period, the fastest in more than a decade, boosted by strength in consumer spending and business investment. The Commerce Department today sharply revised up its estimate of third-quarter growth from a previous figure of 3.9%. Much of that strength came from consumer spending on health care and business spending on structures and computer software. It was the fastest quarterly growth since the summer of 2003 and followed a 4.6% annual growth rate in the April-June quarter. Most economists think growth is slowing to an annual rate of around 2.5% in the current October-December quarter and foresee growth around 3% in 2015â€”the strongest figure since the economy expanded 3.3% in 2005, two years before the Great Recession began. Even after the recession ended in June 2009, the economy has turned in mediocre growth rates, averaging 2.2% annually.

Saying there are people outside with guns, he tells the dispatcher he is on neighborhood watch and asks them to send police. We've got a bunch of hoodlums out here racing, he says. I am locked and loaded. I'm going outside to secure my neighborhood. The dispatcher then attempts to get a numeric address for the caller, but he declines and hangs up.

Divers launched a search near Varazze, a town in the province of Liguria, after more than 80 years of reports from fishermen that they were bringing up Roman pottery shards and artifacts in their nets. The divers believe the wreck is a Roman-era commercial vessel from between the first century BC and the first century AD, and it's extremely well preserved thanks to protective mud on the seabed, the BBC reports. The peculiarity of this is that the wreck could be almost intact, the commander of the police divers' group says. The ship likely would have traveled on Spain-Italy trade routes, and it is believed to contain more than 200 clay amphorae (jars) that probably held fish, wine, oil, and grain. There are some broken jars around the wreck, but we believe that most of the amphorae inside the ship are still sealed and food-filled, the commander says, according to LiveScience. The Age adds that the pine and pitch caps are intact. While divers believe the ship can be raised, the Italian government has not decided whether to do so.

The 29-year-old has retinitis pigmentosa, which affects his peripheral vision and makes it hard for him to see at night. He's been declared legally blind by the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, and Nixon said there's a possibility he may lose his sight forever. But Nixon said it hasn't affected his work.

Morales disputes Nixon's account, saying Nixon wasn't a licensed barber and simply wasn't pulling his weight in the shop. It's a bunch of lies, he told the Herald. All of this is false accusations. Morales said he plans to appeal the state's decision, which awarded Nixon $75,000 in lost wages and $25,000 for emotional distress.

Researchers at King's College London monitored the weight of 278,982 Brits, including 176,000 who were obese, from 2004 to 2014. Excluding those who had weight loss surgery, just 1,283 obese men and 2,245 women returned to a normal body weight during that time, reports the BBC. That means obese men had just a 0.5% chance of getting back to a healthy weight level each year. For women, the rate of success was 0.8%, or almost impossible, a researcher tells HealthDay. For those morbidly obese, the figure was even less encouraging: less than 0.15% for women and much less for men. While 8% of men and 10% of women were able to lose at least 5% of their body weight within a year, more than half had regained the weight two years later, while 78% had after five years, according to a press release. The fact that this yo-yo effectâ€”the cycle of people losing weight, only to gain it back againâ€”was so prevalent shows weight loss strategies for the obese are simply inadequate, researchers say. Current strategies that focus on cutting calories and boosting physical activity aren't working for most patients to achieve weight loss and maintain that, says Alison Fildes, lead author of the study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (researchers didn't monitor how the study participants attempted to lose weight, however). While cutting 5% to 10% of body weight has significant health benefits for the obeseâ€”including lowered blood pressure and blood sugar, reports HealthDayâ€” priority needs to be placed on preventing weight gain in the first place, says Fildes.

Bosses handed out $61,000 worth of the rare bills, an increase on last year's $48,000, they tell the Grand Island Independent. Why the odd system? Two years ago, we caught a lot of flack from the city council and some people in the city of Grand Island for how we donâ€™t support the community ... which we disagreed with, explains VP Jason Hornady. To prove the complaints weren't true, the company chose to make its contribution clear by paying $2-bill bonuses.

But the 2,180-mile path stretching across 14 states from Springer Mountain, Ga., to Katahdin, Maine, is never really finished. It took 15 years for hundreds of volunteers, state and federal partners, trail maintenance clubs, and young workers with the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps to build the original path. In the decades since, nearly 99% has been relocated or rebuilt, and transferred from private to public ownership. It will always be in the same general area, says the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's executive director. But as access to waterways or scenic landscapes along the trail becomes available for purchase, it will continue to shift. Will it move a little to the left, a little to the right? he said. Yes. One of the tenets of the trail is to provide that personal experience of sort of being one with nature. You can't necessarily do that if you're walking along a major highway.

The case goes back to 1982, when somebody shot to death Marilyn Green and fiance Jerry Hillard. Prosecutors first convicted Anthony Porter, who ended up on death row. But 48 hours before he was to die, his conviction got thrown out, thanks to the work of Northwestern University's Medill Innocence Project. One of the project's investigators got Simon to confess to the crime, but both Simon and the investigator later said the confession was coerced. (Simon, now 64, was promised a short sentence, followed by riches from book and movie deals.) The reversal of Porter's conviction led first to a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois less than a year after Porter was pardoned in 1999, and eventually to its abolishment in the state in 2011.

Obama, presiding over a 50-nation war coalition summit in his hometown, summed up the mood by saying the Afghanistan that will be left behind will be stable enough for them to departâ€”essentially good enough after a decade of warâ€”but still loaded with troubles. I don't think there's ever going to be an optimal point where we say, 'This is all done. This is perfect. This is just the way we wanted it,' Obama said as the NATO summit closed. This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process. Obama never spoke of victory.

Stronger banks will be permitted to repay TARPÂ funds and escape restrictions on pay and dividends, while weaker ones will have to address their shortfalls. According to the Times, the weak banks will need less than $100 billion to survive a deep recession.

This all started several weeks ago with a blog post in Venture Beat by Jolie O'Dell who complained about shelling out $6 for a piece of toast and a cup of coffee at a local eatery. O'Dell blamed the city's well-paid tech community for driving up prices at the expense of middle- and working-class families, laying out a cycle that involves the rise of bourgie businesses. The concept of $4 toast has resonated since, and Eddie Kurtz of the group Courage Campaign said it inspired the recent petition.

It feels like there's just a widening gap, and regular people who often don't think about these things are having sticker shock about trying to find an apartment and pay the bills.

He said Wednesday on Facebook there were no takers and that a doctor believes he is developing pneumonia. Dear friends and supporters, it is with profound sadness that I must tell you that my attempts to find a partner in time to save the waterpark from auction has failed, he wrote. I had a number of interested parties but there just wasn't enough time to get the details worked out before the December 2nd auction.

The boy, IDed by the International Business Times as Abrahim Hassan, was born in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere. Abrahim's mother, Shaban, carries the gene for Leigh syndromeâ€”a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child's death before kindergarten. Although Hassan herself is healthy, her first two children died from the disease. That's when she and her husband looked for assistance from NYC's New Hope Fertility Center, where a team led by Dr. John Zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood. There are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique, but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out; that egg, which then contains nuclear DNA from the mom and mitochondrial DNA from the donor, is fertilized with the father's sperm. Five embryos were created in this case, and when just one took, it was implanted into Hassan, who delivered Abrahim nine months later. This all had to be done in Mexico, where Zhang says there are no rules (the Times labels it relatively flexible legislation ; the procedure isn't approved in the US).

A woman who befriended former truck driver's assistant Abraham Shakespeare after he won $30 million in 2006 is a person of interest in the odd and bizarre circumstance of his disappearance, a sheriff says. DeeDee Moore, 37, fashioned herself as Shakespeare's financial adviser and bought his million-dollar home shortly before he disappeared in April, AP reports. After he vanished, she is believed to have texted friends from his cell phone and to have offered people money to make false reports to police about sightings of Shakespeare and to deliver a birthday card, supposedly from him, to his mother.

Both Kim and the prosecution have one week to determine whether to appeal. Prosecutors had previously asked for a 15-year prison term. Kim slashed Mark Lippert during a breakfast forum in Seoul, leaving deep gashes on the envoy's face and arm. Lippert, who needed 80 stitches, was treated for five days at a Seoul hospital. Kim has described himself as an anti-US activist. He told police that his assault was meant to protest annual US-South Korean military drills but that he didn't intend to kill the ambassador. Police said Kim attempted to kill Lippert because he knifed him more than twice with a force that was enough to penetrate the ambassador's arm as he tried to block the attack.

Born in London in 1909 to parents of German-Jewish descent, Winton himself was raised as a Christian. He was a 29-year-old clerk at the London Stock Exchange when a friend contacted him and told him to cancel the skiing holiday they had planned in late 1938 and travel instead to Czechoslovakia. Alarmed by the influx of refugees from the Sudetenland region recently annexed by Germany, Winton and his friend fearedâ€”correctlyâ€”that Czechoslovakia soon would be invaded by the Nazis and Jewish residents from there would be sent to concentration camps. While supporters in Britain were working to get Jewish intellectuals and Communists out of Czechoslovakia, little focus was put on trying to save the children, so Winton took the task upon himself. He persuaded British officials to accept children, as long as foster homes were found and a 50-pound guarantee was paid for each to ensure they had enough money to return home later. Winton set about finding homes and guarantors, and in the months before the outbreak of World War II, Winton got 669 children out, mostly via train. The largest evacuation was scheduled for Sept. 3, 1939, the day that Britain declared war on Germany. That train never left, and almost none of the 250 children trying to flee on it survived the war. For almost 50 years, Winton said nothing about what he had done before the war. It only emerged in 1988 when his wife, Grete, found documents in their attic.

Three men were sent to Georgia and two to Slovakia for resettlement. They were among dozens of low-level prisoners at Guantanamo that an administration task force in 2009 deemed to no longer pose a threat. The release of the men, four Yemenis and a Tunisian, brings the prison population to 143, around 100 fewer than when President Obama took office vowing to close the center. Obama's vow to close Guantanamo was thwarted by Congress, which prohibited sending any prisoner to the US and imposed restrictions that brought releases to a halt. Congress eased the transfer restrictions last December, and releases have resumed. A number of resettlements are expected in the coming weeks. US State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners, and he praises Georgia and Slovakia.

Two years ago, we caught a lot of flack from the city council and some people in the city of Grand Island for how we donâ€™t support the community ... which we disagreed with, explains VP Jason Hornady. To prove the complaints weren't true, the company chose to make its contribution clear by paying $2-bill bonuses. (We) asked our employees to spend that money in town, and if people look at you funny, tell them where you work, and we think that they will notice, Hornady says. The company orders the bills about a month in advance, he notes. Fortunately, the 300 workers don't have to deal entirely in $2 bills: They also receive a nice check and a deposit into their 401(k)s, he adds. Hornady isn't the first company to use the tactic: In 2009, a pharmacist made a similar move in Alabama, the Press-Register reported.

Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts involving sex assaults on 102 girls and a boy. The new charges, including rape and continuous sexual abuse, involve 24 other girls. Some of his victims were just months old, according to authorities. One investigator called the assaults the most brutal on a child I have ever seen.

Rehoboth Beach Police Lt.

She was gone for at least 45 minutes, which was enough time for the kids to go outside and lose control of their dogs, who then apparently dashed in front of a man's car, Riddle says. That witness tells cops he helped the kids rein the animals in, then found out there was no adult around supervising them. Woman's Day points out such a situation can often prove tricky from a legal standpoint: There's no federal law mandating a minimum age at which kids can be left alone, and state rules vary. In Delaware's case, there's no appropriate age to use as a gauge, but the Division of Family Services will accept for investigation any report of a child under the age of 12 being left alone. Terrillion was arrested and released on $500 bail; the kids and dogs are said to be OK.

The decision was a setback for Nestleâ€”which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the USâ€”and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think KitKat, and the court agreed.

Ntaganzwa is among the nine most-wanted fugitives in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, which killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda sought Ntaganzwa to answer charges related to participation in genocide and incitement to commit genocide, but closed its proceedings last week after nearly 20 years of pursuing and prosecuting genocide suspects and transferred Ntaganzwa's case to Rwanda.

On April 15, 1994, Ntaganzwa, armed with a gun, transported gendarmes in a vehicle while Hutu civilians and Burundian refugees he had incited earlier arrived on foot and surrounded Cyahinda Parish to prevent the Tutsis from escaping, the indictment says.

In a majority-black city that hasnâ€™t had a white mayor in 36 years, a Caucasian city councilwoman from a tony neighborhood has a commanding lead in the polls. Mary Norwood has promised to clean up Atlantaâ€™s notoriously bad books, and that goal appears to cross racial lines. Citizens are looking at who they believe can lead the city forward, a state pol tells the Los Angeles Times, rather than their skin tone. Norwood has polled 45% overall in the city, and 34% with black voters. This is particularly surprising since her nearest opponent, whoâ€™s polling at 25% overall, has endorsements from Atlantaâ€™s civil rights establishment and is Mayor Shirley Franklinâ€™s former campaign manager. Franklin hasnâ€™t endorsed anyone, but is explicit in her opposition to Norwood, who she says lacks vision, integrity, and intelligence.

Because the wells are located on tribal land, Oklahoma regulators have no jurisdiction over oil- and gas-producing facilities in the region, reports the AP. The 17 wells are located in a 211-square-mile area within Osage County, near where a magnitude 5.6 temblor struck Saturday, leaving one man with a minor head injury. At least 11 homes and several Oklahoma State University campus buildings were reportedly damaged. The USGS cannot currently conclude whether or not this particular earthquake was caused by industrial-related, human activities, the USGS said in a statement, via the Wall Street Journal. However, we do know that many earthquakes in Oklahoma have been triggered by wastewater fluid injection. We are working closely with the state of Oklahoma, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Osage Nation to evaluate available information and take appropriate next steps to protect public health and the environment, an EPA rep says. State regulators, which since 2013 have asked wastewater-well owners to reduce disposal volumes in parts of the state, already had ordered 37 wells in a 514 square-mile area around the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake to shut down within seven to 10 days because of previous connections between the injection of wastewater and earthquakes. Meanwhile, two more earthquakes of magnitude 4.1 and 3.6 rattled northwest Oklahoma on Tuesday, in an area away from Saturday's quake.

Abbott, who runs the nonprofit Love Thy Neighbor and has been feeding the homeless for more than 20 years, had served up just a handful of meals in Stranahan Park when he was stopped, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

Not so, says writer WC Jameson. In Amelia Earhart: Beyond the Grave, out Tuesday, Jameson builds on the existing theory that Earhart was a spy and was shot down by the Japanese (or captured after a crash or forced landing) and taken prisoner while on a mission to photograph Japanese military installations in the Pacific, Fox News reports. FDR knew about the whole thing, per Jameson, but kept it quiet. Released by the Japanese in 1945, he claims, Earhart returned to the US and lived under the name Irene Craigmile Bolam until she died in 1982, when she would have been about 86. The theory that Earhart was a spy and that she and Noonan were taken prisoner has been around for some time. Early last year a group of men traveled to the Marshall Islands (which was held at the time by the Japanese military, Red Orbit notes) to hunt for evidence to back up the claim, WKYC reports. They found about six pieces of metal they believe came from Earhart's plane. They were having the items tested for authenticity, but there's been no word on the results. For his book, Jameson reportedly interviewed the nephew of a former US Army official who said it was common knowledge in high-ranking intelligence circles that Earhart was involved in an intelligence-gathering operation. Jameson also claims that flight logs from the last Coast Guard station she communicated with were altered after her disappearance.

According to the UN's Zainab Bangura, the terrorist group is circulating a pamphlet that lists specific prices for its captives, including sex slaves and infants. Bangura says she's verified the pamphlet, which first surfaced online in November, since getting hold of a copy in Iraq in April, noting it reflects actual transactions. The girls get peddled like barrels of petrol, she tells Bloomberg. One girl can be sold and bought by five or six different men. Sometimes these fighters sell the girls back to their families for thousands of dollars of ransom. Bangura says the group's leaders get the first pick of captives before outsiders bid into the thousands on those that remain. Afterward, children aged 1 to 9 are typically sold to Islamic State fighters for about $165, according to the pamphlet. The prices then fall as the captives' ages rise. Adolescent girls fetch $124, while women over 20 are sold for less. The organized price list is just another way ISIS differs from other militant groups, Bangura says.

Bellis must make that determination by October; each side will plead its position a final time on Monday. Even if a trial does occur, the Guardian paints the suit as having a remote chance of success. The suits' defendantsâ€”manufacturer Remington, a distributor, and a local gun shopâ€”reference the 2005 federal shield law that has stopped most would-be suits by victims of gun violence, as it provides the makers and sellers with immunity when their guns are used in a crime.

TRAIN_1580,"(Apr 18, 2014 7:56 AM CDT) A team of researchers has made a sure-to-be controversial breakthrough in both stem cell and cloning research, creating stem cells from two adults using cloning techniques. The researchers took DNA from skin cells from two men, aged 35 and 75, and injected it into unfertilized eggs whose DNA had been removed, NBC News explains. They then zapped the eggs with electricity to coax them into dividing until they became early-stage embryos, which were then used to make embryonic stem cellsâ€”with DNA identical to the donors. In theory, the technique could be used to produce tissue perfectly suited to patients. The technique has been carried out successfully once before, but using cells from infants. If you can't do this with adult cells, it is of limited value, a study co-author tells the Wall Street Journal, because there are more diseases the therapy can treat for adults. What the research paper leaves unsaid is that this is also a breakthrough in human cloning, the Washington Post points out.

The problem stems from a $2 drug-test kit used by police departments around the country. They've been around for more than 40 years and haven't changed much in their simplicity: A police officer drops a suspected sample of a drug into a vial of liquid, and if the liquid turns the wrong color, the arrest is made. The story details the many ways the field tests can go wrong, so much so that they're generally inadmissible in court. The problem, though, is that the vast majority of such arrests never end up at trialâ€”those arrested typically plea to lesser charges to avoid the possibility of a lengthy sentence. The story uses the example of 43-year-old Amy Albritton, who took a plea deal and three weeks in jail after a field test suggested she had cocaine in her car, no matter how much she insisted to the contrary. She lost her job and her apartment, and her new felony record kept her from getting any kind of meaningful new work. Turns out, the test was a false positive, which she learned only when informed by the journalists working on this story. Every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence, write Ryan Gabrielson and Topher Sanders.

No one was on base and New York was trailing Boston 5-3 in the bottom of the 10th inning in Game 6.

The buyer's offer: $10,800. Ciudad Real's Central airport, about 150 miles south of Madrid, became a symbol of the country's wasteful spending during a construction boom that ended with the financial crisis of 2008, the year the airport opened. The airport operator went bankrupt in 2012 after it failed to draw enough traffic. Chinese group Tzaneen International tabled the single bid in Friday's auction, Spanish news agency Europa Press said. The receiver had set a minimum price of $30.3 million. If no better bid is received by September, the sale will go through. Tzaneen International reportedly plans to invest up to $108 million in the airport and make it a cargo hub. The offer is for the airport infrastructure only, not adjacent land. Central has one of Europe's longest runways and was designed to handle 2.5 million passengers a year. The construction was heavily funded by the Caja Castilla La Mancha savings bankâ€”the first of Spain's troubled savings banks to be bailed out, in 2010.

A 2014 Bloomberg article explained some of the reasoning behind the software, which mainly related to the use of the speedier PreCheck lane and the selection of the fliers who would randomly be directed there from the regular lane.

Carr died Saturday of complications from a rare form of dementia in Los Angeles, a spokesman tells the AP. At age 21, the actress portrayed Liesl von Trapp in the beloved 1965 movie. She famously performed the song Sixteen Going on Seventeen. After The Sound of Music, Carr's only other major Hollywood role was starring with Anthony Perkins in the Stephen Sondheim television musical Evening Primrose. She went on to become an interior designer in southern California. It's always sad when a member of the family passes awayâ€”and in the case of the 'family' of the movie The Sound of Music, it's especially sad when it is the first of the group to go, said Rogers & Hammerstein president Ted Chapin. Carr played the oldest von Trapp child, and in some ways she maintained that role in real lifeâ€”guiding, cheering, supporting, and generally being there for the rest of her 'sisters' and 'brothers.' Carr is survived by her four siblings, her two children, and four grandchildren.

A US District Court jury decided Apple had violated a 1998 patent for technology that improves processor efficiencyâ€”a patent owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing divisionâ€”by incorporating that technology into the A7, A8, and A8X processors found in its iPhone 5, 6, and 6 Plus models. The jury also found the patent is valid, a claim Apple unsuccessfully tried to take up with the US Patent and Trademark Office before. Presiding Judge William Conley broke the trial down into three phases: liability, damages, and whether Apple had willfully violated the patent, which could lead to more penalties. Indeed, WARF had filed for triple damages because it said the patent infringement was willful, intentional, and in conscious disregard of WARF's right, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. This isn't the first time Apple has been sued for iPad/iPhone patent infringementâ€”Boston University filed a complaint in 2013, the Verge reportsâ€”or the first time WARF has sued over this technology (Intel settled in 2009).

At some point, She apparently knew that the baby had died and that she would need an operation, but she was scared of surgery and fled the hospital, instead opting to get treatment for her abdominal pain at a small clinic, her doctor says, according to the Daily Mail. When the pain came back decades later, however, she allowed doctors to remove the skeleton, which was inside a calcified sac, from her abdomen. We found a lump on the lower right side of her abdomen, and feared it was cancer. A CT scan then revealed that the lump was made of hard, calcified matter, one of the doctors says. But it was only after the patient underwent an MRI that we could make out that the mass was in fact a child's skeleton. The amniotic fluid that protects the fetus might have been absorbed and the soft tissues liquefied over time with only a bag of bones with some fluid remaining. The mass was removed from between Kumar's uterus, intestines, and bladder. Doctors believe it is the world's longest ectopic pregnancy; prior to this, the longest known case involved a Belgian woman who had the remains removed after 18 years.

Kim Jong Un himself surprised the throngs gathered in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square by addressing his nation publicly for the first time, notes the AP. Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists, and the era of enemies using atomic bombs to threaten and blackmail us is forever over, Kim said in a 20-minute speech that underscored his commitment to continuing Korea's military first policy. To wit, Pyongyang unveiled what it says is a new long-range missile at the celebration's finale. The celebration was rife with symbolism, notes the BBC, and appeared designed to highlight the younger Kim's solidarity with the nation's military, as well as give the North its first good look at the young leader. He demonstrated that he can speak in public fairly well, says one Korea expert, who called the speech a good first impression. Kim said his first, second, and third priorities were the military, but also vowed to improve the lives of his people via economic development.

Emergency workers arrived to find the snake still partially inside the toilet. They freed it with hammers and planned to release it back into the wild.

A team of scientists that once laid out nine planetary boundaries that should not be crossed says humans have managed to cross four of them already, reports Reuters. The bad grades come in the categories of rapid species loss, deforestation, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous (think fertilizer) flowing into oceans. We're still OK on ozone depletion, ocean acidification, freshwater use, microscopic particles in the atmosphere, and chemical pollution, write the 18 international researchers in Science. But they warn that the long-term trendâ€”going back to 1950 and the start of rapid economic growth around the worldâ€”doesn't bode well. For the first time in human history, we need to relate to the risk of destabilizing the entire planet, says one of the authors. Bottom line? Lead author Will Steffen tells the Washington Post that at our current pace, the Earth System could unravel in anywhere from decades out to a century. The researchers concede their boundaries are squishy, and the Post illustrates an example involving carbon dioxide levels: The boundary we weren't supposed to cross was 350 parts per million. But we're now well past that and into a zone of uncertainty that extends to 450ppm. And after that? The unknownâ€”planetary conditions unfamiliar to us.

Now, thousands of people might have to pay back their share. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is scrutinizing about 4,500 households that it suspects received improper payments after the storm, according to program officials and data obtained by the AP through a public records request. As of early this month, FEMA had asked around 850 of those households to return a collective $5.8 million; the other cases were still under review. FEMA's campaign to recover overpayments typically involves inadvertent violations of eligibility rules, bureaucratic mistakes, or missing documentation rather than outright fraud. Many people asked to return money were deemed ineligible because their damaged properties were vacation houses or rental properties, not their primary residences. Others had double-dipped into the aid pool, with more than one household member getting payments. Some received FEMA money for things later covered by insurance. As of July 30, the average demanded refund was $6,987, a sum that could be difficult for many, given the modest annual incomes of most aid applicants. Roughly half of the households under scrutiny reported an annual gross income of $30,000 or less.

The feat spawned legends stretching over two centuries, but a new study offers the best clues yet as to how they managed it. Research began in 2012 when a survey uncovered Russian axes at a spot believed to be the survivor camp. Further searches revealed more tools archaeologists say Neva's crew members, who had set out from a Siberian port, used to survive. The items left behind by survivors provide a unique snapshot-in-time for January 1813, and might help us to understand the adaptations that allowed them to await rescue in a frigid, unfamiliar environment for almost a month, the lead researcher says in a release. Based on artifactsâ€”including sheet copper, iron and copper spikes, a copper fishhook, gun flints used to start fires, musket balls carved to fit a smaller caliber firearm, and perhaps part of a navigator's dividersâ€”archaeologists believe crew members gathered ship materials that washed ashore near their destination of Sitka, where survivors were eventually taken; only two who survived the wreck died during the month-long effort. Collectively, the artifacts reflect improvisation in a survival situation, and do not include ceramics, glass and other materials that would be associated with a settlement, the researcher says. Archaeologists add preserved food heaps, still to be examined, will likely reveal the sailors' foraging strategies. Until further studies can be carried out, experts plan to review oral histories of the local Tlingit people for further insight.

But now, thanks to a new study in Science, the answer is 1 trillion, give or take. Researchers had long assumed that the first number, based on relatively rudimentary tests in the 1920s, was way off the mark, and the new study is the first significant one to apply modern methods to revise it, reports Nature. The 1 trillion figure is seen as an average, with some people able to detect as few as 80 million odors and others able to pick up on a mind-boggling thousand trillion of them, according to the scientists' extrapolations. Ten thousand is kind of patheticâ€”itâ€™s a pretty low number, says molecular neurobiologist Leslie Voshall of the Rockefeller University, a co-author of the study. It led to the idea that humans have a comparatively low sense of smell. For their experiment, the scientists used a procedure similar to a hearing exam, in which listeners must try to distinguish between two tones, explains the Washington Post. Researchers combined 128 different odor molecules to create composite scents of varying complexity, then ran them by 26 test subjects. Participants got three vialsâ€”two had identical odors and the third was slightly differentâ€”and had to pick the odd one out, reports NPR. The analysis gets more complicated than that, but after hundreds of experiments on each subject, researchers extrapolated the results to arrive at the 1 trillion average. The study is being well received in the field. Their work confirms that smell is an incredibly rich, variable, and nuanced medium, says one olfactory scientist not involved with the research.

It's not just the sheer number of refugees that's noteworthy: They're mainly Kurds, and as the BBC reports, many are deeply hostile to Turkey. And since Thursday, they've been pouring into the country in an attempt to flee ISIS militants who have, as the AP puts it, pushed the conflict nearly within eyeshot of the Turkish border. The current conflict centers around the town of Kobani, which ISIS attempted to take in July, reports Reuters. That attempt was quelled with the help of Kurds who entered Syria from Turkey, and there were skirmishes on the Turkish side of the border yesterday as the country tried to prevent Kurds from flowing into Syria once again. As BBC correspondent Mark Lowen explains, there's a fear that the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which for decades battled for autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey, could team up with a beefed-up Syrian Kurdish militia and once again take up arms within Turkey. For now, the Syrian Kurdish fighters are said to have halted an ISIS advance on Kobani from the east, according to a rep for the Kurdish group, who says that's the front where the most intense fighting is taking place.","In 4 Days, ____K Syrians Flee ISIS","Paraphrase(130,000,K)",130

The 30-year-old homesteader says he woke up in the middle of the night on Dec. 17 or 18 to find the cabin on fire. He grabbed some coats and blankets and fled outside before it became an inferno, and was heartbroken to find out that his 6-year-old chocolate lab hadn't left when he yelled at him to get out. Steele spent the next two nights in a snow cave and then built a makeshift shelter over the ruins of his cabin, where he spent 22 or 23 days in subzero temperatures and deep snow before he was rescued by an aircrew with Alaska State Troopers on Thursday, NBC reports. The only way in or out of the remote corner of the Susitna Valley was by plane, authorities say. Steele's nearest neighbor was more than 20 miles away. Steele, who had been living in the cabin since September, had no snowmobile or working phone. He says he managed to scavenge enough cans of food from the wreckage to surviveâ€”but much of it tasted like burnt plastic.

But even as her company's controversy grew, Bresch did something else that's getting scrutinized: She unloaded about 100,000 shares of stock on August 9, to the tune of a $5 million profit. Bresch did so under a 10b5 plan, which spans a certain waiting period and are set up to avoid the appearance of insider trading, reports the Guardian. Yet, as the Guardian writes, Bresch did not need insider information to know that trouble lay ahead. The grumbling about the price of EpiPen goes back to at least last September, when Bloomberg reported on EpiPen's marketing success story while noting the price had gone up 400%. Mylan subsequently hiked EpiPen's price again. In June, Wells Fargo noted in a report that Mylan had jacked prices on seven products by at least 100%, and on 24 products by at least 20%, hikes it said could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk.

That may be too much of a good thing, because you're more likely to suffer a stroke, according to a study out of the University of Cambridge. Researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 10,000 people ages 42 to 81 in the UK, and they report in the journal Neurology that based on nearly a decade of follow-up and 346 reported strokes, older adults who sleep more than eight hours a night are 46% more likely to suffer a stroke than adults who slept six to eight hours. That risk is actually four times greater when people went from sleeping for less than six hours at the beginning of the study to more than 8 as the years passed, per a Eureka Alert press release. The researchers adjusted for several factors, including age and sex, and their findings were strikingly consistent with what they found in a review of the combined data of 11 similar studies spanning 560,000 people in seven countries. But in terms of age and sex, the Los Angeles Times notes the following: The link between the risk and sleep length was a little stronger for women, and the increased stroke risk was only seen in those eight-plus-hours sleepers who were 63 or older. The researchers caution that it remains unclear whether longer sleep duration is a symptom or cause of stroke risk.

And the lawmakers aren't blind to potential conflicts of interest: They check in with ethics committee lawyers thousands of times per year. From 2007 to 2011, those lawyers offered some 2,800 opinions on such matters, making 40,000 phone calls in the process. But these communications rarely seek to dissuade legislators from their goals; in fact, they typically help justify the efforts. Lawmakers argue that they're fighting for the greater good, which in some cases matches their own interests. And indeed, ethics rules seem to support that argument, offering exemptions to a financial conflict-of-interest rule. For instance, if a dairy farmer represented a dairy farming state in the Senate... he would not fall under the strictures of this rule, says the Senate ethics manual.

One of the victims ran back to his car, and the guy dressed as Santa Claus must've thought he was going to get a gun because he started shooting.

Gary Herbert signed into law a bill requiring anesthesia for patients who reach this mark, USA Today reports. The Protecting Unborn Children mandate is the first of its kind to pass in the US, rekindling a debate as to whether a fetus can feel pain at that point in the gestational cycle. (The Washington Post notes a review of more than 300 studies shows the fetus likely doesn't perceive pain before 28 weeks.) The governor believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child, a spokesman for Herbert said in a statement. The law wouldn't apply in cases where anesthesia could hurt the mother, if the abortion was needed to save the mother's life, or if the fetus suffered from a congenital defect that would prove fatal, per the AP and USA Today. Other states have tried for similar laws and failed; a dozen states ban abortion after between 20 and 22 weeks, while others offer the option of anesthesia. Critics note the law could be applied in cases where labor is induced, such as with pre-eclampsia or when a woman's due date has passed. State Sen. Curt Bramble, who sponsored the bill, argues anesthesia is used in other situations in Utah, such as for convicts put to death and animals being put down, so this law simply maintains consistency. We go to extraordinary lengths in Utah to prevent the pain of an individual sentenced to death, he says.",Anesthesia Now Required in Utah Abortions After ____ Weeks,Copy(20),20

Bourla sold shares worth $5.6 million as the company's stock price soared on Monday, but the company says it was part of a predetermined 10b5-1 plan for Bourla to sell off some of his Pfizer shares. A Pfizer spokeswoman tells CNN that the shares were sold because they hit a price set as part of a plan Bourla authorized in August. These are predetermined plans managed through a third-party stock administrator, the spokeswoman said when asked whether the CEO had considered delaying the sale. The company says Bourla still holds approximately nine times his salary in Pfizer stock. Predetermined 10b5-1 plans are intended to shield executives from accusations of insider trading, but the Pfizer CEO's stock sale plan was implemented on Aug. 19, the day before the company made an earlier major announcement on the vaccine's progress. Daniel Taylor, an expert in insider trading at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, tells NPR that the timing looks very suspicious. It's wholly inappropriate for executives at pharmaceutical companies to be implementing or modifying 10b5-1 plans the business day before they announce data or results from drug trials, Taylor says.

The sources say Trump, who has publicly refused to concede the election and vowed to fight the results in court, has told advisers he is considering another run.

That confection, the auction house tells the BBC, was probably the most controversial chocolate ever made.

But even more notable was what came out with the water that spewed up to 30 feet in the air: 80 years worth of trash. After the eruption, officials wrote on Facebook, park employees found a strange assortment of items strewn across the landscape around its vent, from dozens of coins that people threw in to make wishes to just plain garbage: aluminum cans, plastic cups, cigarette butts, a broken bottle, etc. But some of the items that spewed forth are clearly historic, including items like a baby pacifier dating as far back as the 1930s. They'll be inventoried by curators and may end up in Yellowstone's archives. Some of the items had clearly been tossed in on purpose; others may have fallen in accidentally. But either way, foreign objects can damage hot springs and geysers, the post continues. The next time Ear Spring erupts we hope it's nothing but natural rocks and water.

The Portland Press Herald has the ironic story of Douglas Parkhurst, who was at the Babe Ruth baseball game his grandson was participating in and was killed by the car driven by Carol Sharrow, 51. Parkhurst himself confessed to a deadly hit-and-run in 2013, bringing some answers but little solace to the family of Carolee Ashby, a 4-year-old killed on Oct. 31, 1968, as she walked to a store in Fulton, New York, with her then 15-year-old sister to buy birthday candles for the teenager's cake. Though police initially eyed Parkhurst as a suspect, a 2012 tip to police was what ended up spurring Parkhurst's confession. That confession reportedly came only after Parkhurst received assurances from prosecutors that the statute of limitations had passed and he would not be prosecuted. Darlene Ashby McCann, the sister who was with Carolee when she was killed, says her family never received an apology from Parkhurst. Still, now I am relieved, she says. I truly am.

We've had an absolute horrendous tragedy, numbers of lives lost, and we have not completed the door-to-door, the minister says. The hurricane, which hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm, is believed to have destroyed or severely damaged around half the homes on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, which are home to around 70,000 people, reports the AP. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Wednesday that the storm had caused generational devastation in the islands, where rescue crews have yet to reach some areas and survivors are desperate for food, medicine, and water. Minnis said health workers have been sent to the islands, along with hundreds of police and marines, to restore order amid reports of widespread looting, Bloomberg reports. Bahamians are distressed that anyone would loot and further the suffering of those affected by this tragedy, Minnis said. Be warned, we will prosecute looters and other law breakers to the full extent of the law. The US Coast Guard and the British Royal Marines have brought dozens of critically injured survivors to a rescue center in the capital, Nassau, the Guardian reports.

Flash forward to the present, and the Florida woman is embroiled in a lawsuit against her son over the handling of her fortune. The Florida Times-Union reports the suit was filed in 2018 but discussed in court this week. It targets Scott Mackenzie, who has power of attorney over her finances. Gloria alleges he prevented her from earning tens of millions of dollars she should have generated in gains by relying on an unqualified investment adviser who charged her $2 million in fees. The adviser is Harry Madden, co-host of a radio call-in show that doles out financial advice. Her suit alleges that in the 3.5 years Madden managed her money, she saw a return of less than 1%, reports the Jacksonville Business Journal. The suit says family members in 2014 shared with her a report detailing three past complaints against Madden, a move that had Scott threatening the family members with being cut out of Gloria's money. The suit initially filed by Gloria was dismissed in February; she filed an amended version the next month alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, and exploitation of a vulnerable adult. On Tuesday, Scott's lawyers argued this one should also be dismissed, saying that her money was put in conservative investment vehicles per her wishesâ€”CDs and money market accounts, per the APâ€”and that the fact her money didn't grow as much as she would have liked isn't grounds for a lawsuit.",____-Year-Old Powerball Winner Sues Son Over Money,Copy(90),90

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment. Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman, and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified. DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development.

A rep for the Citadel hedge fund founder said he intended to use the 24,000-square-foot home when he's in New York to work at a new Citadel office there, and the decision seemingly set the stage for New York's sudden embrace of a first-in-America tax on uber-luxe second homes, writes the New York Times. The pied-Ã -terre tax, as it's known, is en force in cities like Paris, Singapore, and Vancouver; a proposal currently being considered by the State Legislature would apply a sliding tax surcharge to second homes in the city that are valued at more than $5 million. The revenue could be substantial: Based on 2017 numbers, 5,400 NYC homes would be subject to the tax, and Gov.

Lana Wachowski, who wrote, directed, and produced the first three movies with her sister, Lilly, will be at the helm of the latest movie, the BBC reports. We could not be more excited to be re-entering the Matrix with Lana, says Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby Emmerich.

The sources say production is set to begin early next year. Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now, Wachowski says.

The company's marketing director says they were able to determine that the sign, which can be seen here, was washed away from outside a home in the town of Brielle. The finder, 64-year-old Hannes Frank, says it was curious to find the sign on a Bordeaux beach. He says he looked up the name on the sign and emailed the realtor to let them know it had arrived, though it was not in best shape after the crossing. He offered to send it back to the realtor, who plans to frame it as a memento. Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer tells the New York Times that the sign's journey was likely even longer than it might appear. He believes it crossed the Atlantic three times before it was found.

In one recent case, an ambulance carrying a man with a fever and difficulty breathing was rejected by 80 hospitals and forced to search for hours for a hospital in downtown Tokyo that would treat him, per the AP. Another feverish man finally reached a hospital after paramedics unsuccessfully contacted 40 clinics. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine say many hospital ERs are refusing to treat people, including those suffering strokes, heart attacks, and external injuries. Japan initially seemed to have controlled the outbreak by going after clusters of infections in specific places, usually enclosed spaces such as clubs, gyms, and meeting venues. But the spread of virus outpaced this approach, and most new cases are untraceable. The outbreak has highlighted underlying weaknesses in medical care in Japan, which has long been praised for its high-quality insurance system and reasonable costs. Apart from a general unwillingness to embrace social distancing, experts fault government incompetence and a widespread shortage of the protective gear and equipment medical workers need to do their jobs. The collapse of emergency medicine has already happened, a precursor to the overall collapse of medicine, the JAAM and the JSEM said in a joint statement.

I donâ€™t remember what I did at the crime ... because I wasnâ€™t there, apparently. The Beatrice Six are a unique case in the history of American crime, and the New Yorker takes a long look at their harrowing experience. The six were convicted of raping and killing Helen Wilson in 1985 despite not matching blood and semen found at the scene. Even after a judge in 2009 found they were innocent beyond all doubt, many of the six still have vivid memories of committing the crime. Some still don't seem convinced of their own innocence; they can feel the pillow they believe they used to smother Wilson and remember who else was in her apartment when they did it. Psychiatrist Eli Chesen says the Beatrice Six suffered Stockholm syndrome at the hands of a local psychiatrist named Wayne Price. A number of the Beatrice Six had been treated by Price before becoming suspects in the crime. They had histories of abuse, mental health issues, and more. We were all broken in one way, shape, or form, says one. A pig farmer-turned-sheriff's detective obsessed with the case started fingering people on the fringes of Nebraska society as guilty, and Price convinced the already suggestible suspects of that guilt, insisting their dreams were real memories of the crime.

Piala Inc., a Tokyo-based marketing firm, introduced a policy last month granting six extra paid holidays per year to non-smoking employees to make up for the cigarette breaks of employees who do smoke. It all started when a non-smoker used the company suggestion box to complain about smoking breaks, a spokesperson tells the Telegraph. Our CEO saw the comment and agreed, so we are giving non-smokers some extra time off to compensate, the spokesperson explains. Smoke breaks are particularly time-consuming at the companyâ€”about 15 minutes eachâ€”because smokers must travel from the office on the 29th floor to the basement. So far, 25% of the employees have taken days off under the new policyâ€”and, at least according to the spokesperson, four people have quit smoking as a result of the policy. Kyodo News says in Japan, where 21.7% of adults are estimated to smoke, more companies are starting to attempt to rein in the practice, with one company going so far as to ban smoking during work hours.

Allyn Gibson (the owners' son, per Fox News) got into an altercation with him and two other black students. The next day, more than 100 people attended a student-organized protest outside the bakery, chanting things like Gibson's is racist and handing out pamphlets encouraging people to boycott the bakery and claiming it had a racist history. Oberlin also put a hold on business done with the bakery, per Inside Higher Ed. However, the three students were eventually arrested and admitted fault; they pleaded guilty and signed statements affirming the incident wasn't based on race. In November 2017, Gibson's sued Oberlin and its dean of students, Meredith Raimondo, accusing the school of helping to organize the protests and encouraging students to demonstrate, using university funds to buy gloves for students involved in the protest and passing a resolution, via the student government, stating that Gibson's was racist. Deans, professors, and other college staffers also took part in the protest, per CNN.

The Douglas Dispatch in 2010 reported that no items were missing from Fugate's home to suggest he actively disappeared. The Times reported that friends and family (he left behind a wife) suspected he came across a drug deal in progressâ€”drug deals had been known to occur at the monument, which sits roughly 60 miles from the Mexican borderâ€”and that the uniform and badge he was wearing caused those he encountered to panic and abduct him.

The rare findâ€”actually two vases in one, with a pierced outer layer of yangcai ( foreign colors ) and an inner layer painted in traditional blue and whiteâ€”was once owned by British collector Harry Garner, who sold it for the modern-day equivalent of $1,500 in 1954, according to Sotheby's. Some time later, a woman inherited the vase without knowing much about its worthâ€”that is, until a Sotheby's expert arrived to inspect it, per Atlas Obscura. The auction house says double-walled vases like this one were only made over two years in the early 1740s, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Overseen by imperial kiln supervisor Tang Ying, the extremely small group of pierced, double-walled vases that were produced for the Qianlong Emperor provided probably the greatest technical challenge ever for the potters at the imperial kilns, a ceramics scholar notes. The perfection of the execution is next to miraculous. Sotheby's says imperial records suggest the emperor considered the vase a masterwork and displayed it at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, where he hosted banquets. Before realizing its value, its most recent owner kept the foot-tall vase with Rococo-style flowers and celadon-green lattice in an open cupboard in a home with multiple cats and dogs, per Smithsonian.

As a gate agent, Jenkins had access to the airline's computer reservation database and had the ability to use a special code, referred to as an involuntary exchange or 'INVOL' to change flights for customers at no additional cost, US Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a statement. This code enables agents to change flights for customers who miss their flights or experience a death in the family.

Well, keep wondering, but an excerpt from an unreleased Japanese documentary has Kubrick explaining the film's mysterious ending, BoingBoing reports. I've tried to avoid doing this ever since the picture came out. When you just say the ideas they sound foolish, whereas if theyâ€™re dramatized one feels it, but I'll try, the famed director of Dr. Strangelove and The Shining tells TV personality Jun'ichi Yaio in a phone call. The idea was supposed to be that [the astronaut played by actor Keir Dullea] is taken in by god-like entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time. After discussing the deliberately inaccurate French architecture of the room in the closing scene, Kubrick says that when they get finished with him, as happens in so many myths of all cultures in the world, he is transformed into some kind of super being and sent back to Earth, transformed and made into some sort of superman. We have to only guess what happens when he goes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest.

The study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology suggests that people who follow general exercise guidelines of 2.5 to 5 hours a week of moderate activity (brisk walking, for example) or 1.25 to 2.5 hours of more vigorous activity (swimming, jogging, etc.) might decrease their chances of getting the seven cancersâ€”colon, breast, kidney, myeloma, liver, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and endometrial, reports CNN. The possible benefits varied, from a 6% to 10% lower risk of breast cancer to an 18% to 27% lower risk of liver cancer. The research analyzed data from studies involving more than 750,000 men and women in the US, Australia, and Europe over a decade. Exercise guidelines have largely been based on their impact on chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, says Alpa Patel, senior scientific director of epidemiology research at the American Cancer Society. But these data provide strong support that these recommended levels are important to cancer prevention, as well. Coverage notes that the research was observational, meaning it does not prove a cause-and-effect between exercise and a lower cancer risk. Still, Forbes finds it interesting that the study suggests a correlation between the amount of exercise and lower risk.

Those words are from a YouTube video recorded before the March disappearance of Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoumâ€”the daughter of UAE Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoumâ€”who the Guardian reports tried to flee a life of caged luxury. Deemed the mystery of the missing princess by the BBC, the 32-year-old's story took a chaotic turn in March when, after what friends say was a seven-year plot to escape her oppressive life, Latifa was snatched from her escape yacht off of India by armed men. Latifa's sister, Shamsa, had attempted a similar escape in 2000; it's still murky what happened to her after she was apparently recaptured. The Guardian and a new BBC documentary detail Latifa's escape attempt, which reportedly began with a letter she sent in 2011 to a former French navy officer who'd escaped Dubai himself in the late '90s after some legal troubles there. A friend tells the BBC she was the one on the day of Latifa's escape who drove the princess to Oman, then helped her get to a yacht at sea via inflatable boat and Jet Ski. Days after that, the ship was raided and Latifa disappeared; her Instagram was shuttered soon after. If you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing, Latifa says in the recording. Either I'm dead or I'm in a very, very, very bad situation. In April, the Guardian quoted a source said to be close to the Dubai rulers who said Latifa had been returned home, was with her family, and was doing excellent.

TRAIN_1996,"(Mar 27, 2018 8:00 AM CDT) A 101-year-old actress has lost her unusual but closely watched Hollywood lawsuit. An appeals court panel on Monday ruled against Olivia de Havilland in her complaint against the docudrama Feud: Bette and Joan, per the Hollywood Reporter. The actress objected to her portrayal in the FX Networks series, saying she came off as gossipy and crude. For example, she says she would have never used the word bitch, as Catherine Zeta-Jones does in portraying her. Series creator Ryan Murphy, however, countered that the series' depiction of de Havilland is protected on free-speech groundsâ€”and justices on the 2nd US District Court of Appeals in California agreed. Whether a person portrayed in one of these expressive works is a world-renowned film starâ€”â€˜a living legendâ€™â€”or a person no one knows, she or he does not own history, wrote Justice Anne Egerton. Nor does she or he have the legal right to control, dictate, approve, disapprove, or veto the creatorâ€™s portrayal of actual people. Murphy hailed the ruling as a victory for the arts and the First Amendment, but de Havilland's attorney already is planning an appeal, notes Variety. In a harsh critique, she accused Egerton of being an industry insider, citing her background as an NBC exec in the 1990s. This is an entirely pro-industry decision, and was clearly written before the hearing less than a week ago.","Judge to ____-Year-Old Actress: Sorry, You Don't 'Own History'",Copy(101),101
