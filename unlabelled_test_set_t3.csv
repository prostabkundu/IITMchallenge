Warren's last physical was in January and was conducted by Dr. Beverly Woo, who said she has been the candidate's primary care physician since 1999. Woo wrote in a letter dated this week that Warren's only medical condition is an underactive thyroid gland easily treated by medication, the only kind she takes, per the AP. The senator, 70, had a flu shot in October, and a routine mammogram in January found no sign of trouble. At 5 feet, 8 inches, she weighs 129 pounds, exercises regularly and follows a healthy diet, the doctor wrote. She has never smoked, misused drugs or had a problem with alcohol.",Warren Is First of ____-Something Candidates Out With Medical Report

The company said it will focus instead on fulfilling contracts with military and police customers for rifles, the AP reports. The fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity, Colt's chief executive officer, Dennis Veilleux, said in a statement. Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.",Colt Suspends Production of AR-____ Rifles for Civilians
TEST_3,"(Oct 19, 2020 3:00 AM CDT) David Perdue's perceived mocking of Kamala Harris's name worked out well ... for his political rival. The Republican senator repeatedly mispronounced the VP nominee's name while at a Friday rally for President Trump, a move decried as racist, and it spawned a trending hashtag on Twitter: #MyNameIs, in which users tweeted about their names and slammed Perdue. At the rally, Perdue referred to Harris and said, KAH-mah-lah? Kah-MAH-lah? Kamala-mala-mala? I donâ€™t know. Whatever, per Fox 5. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is running against Perdue, said that since the moment went viral he had raised more than $1.8 million by Sunday night. Ossoff called the incident bigoted mockery, but Perdue insisted to reporters Saturday he meant absolutely no disrespect to Harris and did not intentionally mess with her name. WJCL has this statement from a spokesman: Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris' name, and he didn't mean anything by it, it reads. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing, which includes the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all, raising taxes, and holding up COVID-19 relief for the people of Georgia.

TEST_4,"(Jul 1, 2020 8:41 AM CDT) You're not supposed to stare at the sun, but a new NASA film lets you safely do so for an entire hour. Per the Guardian, the space agency has released a decade's worth of mesmerizing footage of our resident star, taken from February 2010 all the way up to last month by a trio of instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Per NASA, the SDO stitched together 425 million high-res images into a 61-minute video, set to a soothing score by German musician Lars Leonhard, that depicts a full solar cycleâ€”complete with developing sunspots, eruptions, and planets passing by. The SDO snapped a photo of the sun every 0.75 seconds, on average, with one of the instruments capturing a picture every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light. As for some parts of the video that seem amiss: NASA explains that at points when the sun seems off-center, the SDO instruments were recalibrating, while occasional dark frames (such as that seen at 53:29 in the video) were from the Earth or moon obscuring the light as they passed between the spacecraft and the sun. A slightly longer blackout in early August 2016 took place when there was a problem with one of the instruments, which was taken care of after about a week. Newsweek notes that the video comes out right before the European Space Agency releases the closest pictures of the sun ever taken, shot from the NASA-ESA Solar Orbiter, which got as close as 48 million miles away from the sun's surface. Those images are due out in mid-July. The sun will remain under the SDO's gaze until 2030.","Here Comes the Sunâ€”____ Years of It, in One Hour"
TEST_5,"(Aug 28, 2020 2:33 PM CDT) Health officials in Charlotte said Friday they conducted 792 coronavirus tests connected to the Republican National Convention, and four test resultsâ€”for two attendees and two local employeesâ€”were positive, the Hill reports. We had diligent safety protocols in place, including testing all attendees before arriving in Charlotte, and again upon arrival, a party official said. The four people who tested positive did so upon arrival and were sent home, per Politico. The party also issued badges to attendees that logged their movements to help contact tracers if needed. The original plans for a full convention were reduced to allow for a few hundred delegates to nominate President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Monday. Both traveled to Charlotte to address the delegates. Mecklenburg County health officials were worried by the lack of social distancing and masks during the roll call vote on the Trump's nomination, per the Observer. Delegates can be seen on video crowding together, often for photos. The four who tested positive were told to isolate; those who were in close contact with them also were told to self-quarantine. The county's public health director said people in the Charlotte area were not at heightened risk. There have been no known incidences during the five days of RNC meetings in Charlotte where the public has potentially been exposed, she said. The county said the number of new infections has been falling, but nearly 25,000 confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported overall.",____ Test Positive for COVID at RNC
TEST_6,"(Mar 22, 2020 6:11 AM CDT) America could soon have in its increasingly hot little hands a coronavirus test that turns around results in about 45 minutes, reports CNN, after the FDA approved the first such rapid test on Friday. The diagnostic comes from manufacturer Cepheid, and tests should begin shipping next week. Cepheid's test is a far cry from current turnaround times, which range from 24 hours to four days, and could cripple the nation's health care system if physicians are unable to rapidly diagnose patients. One CEO of a large hospital system called that lag time unacceptable. Clinicians urgently need an on-demand diagnostic test for real-time management of patients being evaluated for admission to health-care facilities, says Cepheid's CEO. In another development on the testing front, Fox News reports on the emergence of home testing kits, including an offering from Nurx. Customers go online, fill out a form with their symptoms, and mail in a testing kit for $181. We donâ€™t look for the severity of symptoms, only the presence of them, a rep says, though she cautions that people with truly severe symptoms should also seek immediate care. These advances don't mean everyone should run out and get tested: If you don't have symptoms, don't do a test, Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. It is another way that the American people can make sure that we are preserving the resources that our health care workers need to administer and support those who are dealing with the coronavirus and other illnesses.

Others were illâ€”dehydrated, vomiting and weak, the Guardian reports. It was a nightmare, a witness said. The Ukraine International Airlines plane landed June 13 Pearson airport carrying French bulldogs. Canadian law prohibits ferrying animals in an unsafe way that could injure them or cause suffering. There also are regulations to prevent spreading disease when importing animals, per the Globe and Mail. The airline said it was cooperating with the investigation and posted an apology online Friday, calling it a tragic loss of animal life. Flights often leave Ukraine and Eastern Europe packed with young puppies brought west for resale, said an SPCA International official in Ukraine. These commercial operations are run by large puppy mills that house and breed hundreds and thousands of dogs every year in typically unsterile conditions, he said, per the CBC. There isn't enough room in the cargo hold to safely put hundreds of animals, he said, resulting in what the witness called a horror show. French bulldog puppies can sell for $3,000 to $4,000 each, said a professor who is studying the issue with the government.

TEST_11,"(Jun 1, 2018 10:45 AM CDT) Vermont wants to pay you up to $10,000 to move there, and, yes, there's a catch. To qualify for the funds, you need to be a full-time employee of an out-of-state business who works from home. The unusual proposal, which comes with a new law signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, aims to add to Vermont's small and aging population of 625,000 at a time when a thriving US labor market is making it difficult to retain workers, reports CNN. We recognize the need to recruit people to the state, and this is one of those efforts, Joan Goldstein, the state's commissioner of economic development, says of the Remote Worker Grant Program, which will provide up to $10,000 over two years to full-time workers who relocate to the state but work remotely for an out-of-state employer. The funds are meant to cover the cost of moving, computers, internet, and other work-related expenses. Interested workers will want to act fast. The state has only budgeted for 100 grants to be given out over the next three years, on a first-come, first-serve basis beginning on Jan. 1, 2019, and Goldstein says her office is already receiving inquiries. That should please Scott, who notes the state has about 16,000 fewer workers than we did in 2009, per CNBC. He hopes a separate state program will also help.

Benson and a woman died after a motorcycle collided with a mini-van crossing an intersection, per KXAN.

Benson was a Longhorn hero, scoring 64 rushing touchdowns over four seasons, 1,000 yards each season, and 5,540 yards overall, the ninth-best among college gridiron rushers. The Texas native also won the coveted Doak Walker Award for America's best running back and was an All-American in 2004.

Publicist Gwendolyn Quinn tells the AP that Franklin died Thursday at 9:50am at her home in Detroit. Franklin, who'd battled undisclosed health issues in recent years, had in 2017 announced her retirement from touring. A professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens, and a superstar by her mid-20s, Franklin had long ago settled any arguments over who was the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her gifts were a multi-octave mezzo-soprano, gospel passion, and training worthy of a preacher's daughter. She recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half-century, including 20 that reached No. 1 on the R&B charts. But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, to the wised-up Chain of Fools, to her unstoppable call for Respect. Her records sold millions of copies and the music industry couldn't honor her enough. Franklin won 18 Grammy Awards. In 1987, she became the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In a 2004 interview, Franklin was asked whether she sensed in the '60s that she was helping change popular music. Somewhat, certainly with 'Respect,' that was a battle cry for freedom and many people of many ethnicities took pride in that word, she answered.

He had been serving a prison sentence for a 1975 rape at the time of his death. After his death, authorities started linking him to other assaults in the same area during the same time period. Authorities found one of his male relatives via Ancestry.com, Boston.com reports; that relative gave a DNA sample that was matched to a sample taken when Britton was found dead. Sumpter had already been posthumously found responsible for a 1973 murder and rape of a 24-year-old and the 1972 murder and rape of a 23-year-old; he is also believed to have committed a rape in 1985 when he escaped from a work release.

Reuters notes that's only phase one, however, in Edwin Hardeman's case, with the cause of his cancer kept separate from potential liability by Bayer AG, which acquired Monsanto, the weed killer's maker, last year. The unanimous decision handed down this week by a federal court said Roundup was a substantial factor in Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, moving the case into liability phase, where Hardeman's legal team will argue that Monsanto misled the public on glyphosate's health risks and should be held responsible, per the New York Times. We feel confident ... a jury ... will see that Monsanto has committed 40 years of corporate malfeasance, a Hardeman attorney says. This decision comes on the heels of last August's ruling that Monsanto must pay Dewayne Johnson $289 million, finding the weed killer contributed to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; per Reuters, that amount has since been reduced to $78 million and the case is in appeals. Bolstering Bayer's argument is the fact that regulators such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency have ruled glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen, though the World Health Organization disagrees and says it probably is. We have great sympathy for Mr. Hardeman ... but an extensive body of science supports the conclusion that Roundup was not the cause of his cancer, Bayer says in a statement.

Wild horses and burros can damage rangelands, and if their numbers get too highâ€”as they currently areâ€”some of them starve. The current number is more than triple what rangelands can support, Insider reports. So the BLM rounds them up and corrals them, adopting out some of the less feral ones. But most corrals right now are at capacity, and adoptions are down. Hence the incentive program. The incentive is designed to help with the adopterâ€™s initial training and humane care, says BLM's deputy director of programs and policy. According to the BLM website, adopters must pay a $25 adoption fee and meet the BLM's requirements for adopting a wild horse or burro. After that, adopters will receive $500 after the adoption and another $500 after titling the animal, which typically occurs about a year after adoption, per the Reno Gazette Journal.

Both WTVA and WCBI report that the girl died Sunday evening. By the police account, the boy grabbed the gun and shot his sister in the head earlier that afternoon when she wouldn't give up the controller. Their mother was in another room at the time, and it wasn't clear how the boy got access to the gun or whether he knew the full consequences of his actions, police said. Heâ€™s just 9, says Monroe County Sheriff Cecil Cantrell. I assume heâ€™s seen this on video games or TV.

Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh, Cassandra Rivera, and Anna Vasquez were declared innocent after being wrongfully convicted of sexually assaulting two of Ramirez's nieces, then aged 7 and 9, in 1997 in what the state's expert witness then described as a satanic-related ritual. The alleged victims told police in 1994 that the women, who are openly gay, assaulted them at Ramirez's apartment but their testimony varied wildly, reports the San Antonio Current. Ramirez was later sentenced to 37.5 years in prison, while the others were sentenced to 15 years. Vasquez was paroled in 2012, while the others were granted bail a year later, after one of the two alleged victims recanted and the state's witness retracted her testimony. Earlier this year, a state district court judge overturned their convictions, which came at a time of anti-gay bias and national hysteria â€¦ over satanic sexual abuse, reports KSAT. But the judges on Wednesday found the woman, all in their 40s, have unquestionably established that they are innocent, and noted the father of Ramirez's nieces has engaged in a pattern of threatening behavior towards the complainants and false allegations of sexual assault.

We were very impressed that it was at the top of a tree, McCall Fire Captain Brandon Swain tells the Idaho Statesman. We really didnâ€™t say much when we got on scene.

We were nervous, Swain says. The majority of the limbs at the top were helping support that plane. Acker then cut the pilot's harness and clipped him to a safety line.

Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Mark Weber confirmed that the girl, who was taken into custody in Texas in March of 2018, died of fever and respiratory distress at a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. Weber said the girl was in a medically fragile state when she arrived at a facility in San Antonio and ended up in a comatose state after complications from a surgery. Weber said the girl was sent to a palliative care facility in Phoenix then moved to the Nebraska facility three days before her death to be closer to relatives. US Rep, Joaquin Castro accuses the administration of covering up the death. I have not seen any indication that the Trump administration disclosed the death of this young girl to the public or even to Congress, the Democrat tells CBS.

The gunman also set fires that damaged or destroyed more than five structures and cars, the CBC reports. Among the victims killed were two nurses, Kristen Beaton and Heather O'Brien. Beaton, the mother of a 3-year-old son who was pregnant with a second child, was on her way to see a continuing care client when she was killed Sunday morning. Her husband says the province's failure to send out any emergency alerts doomed his wife. They didn't realize the gunman was wearing a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform and driving a police vehicle until it was too late. I would not have let my wife leave ... if I had that broadcast come across, that he was on the loose and he was driving an RCMP vehicle, he says, per the CBC.

Per a DHS document Reuters saw, the agency has pored over the existing funds and resources President Trump said would be tapped to pay for a wall along the country's border with Mexico, and it only came up with about $20 millionâ€”or $21.58 billion short of the $21.6 billion it's expected to take to erect a wall and accompanying fence along the entire stretch. The report, which DHS is said to have presented to congressional budget staff last week, notes that amount could get some signatures on contracts for wall prototypes, but it wouldn't cover breaking ground on any structures. Mic notes that, based on DHS estimates, the newly found reserves would pay for one whole mile of wall ; the US-Mexico border spans about 2,000 miles, per CNBC. Trump's wall plans, spelled out in a January executive order, stated that the US would pay for the wall with government funds and that reimbursement would later come from Mexico (though Mexico has said repeatedly it won't be paying a cent). Fox News notes that Trump initially said the wall would cost just $12 billion; he said at the time that wall-building would begin in just months. That timeline may need to be tweaked as the president likely goes to Plan B for making up the shortage: asking Congress for the rest.

Redouane's age was not immediately known because he gave two different dates of birth. Both men were from the Barking neighborhood of East London, where police raids began shortly after the attacks Saturday night. Police say investigations are continuing into the identity of the third attacker. The three suspects were shot dead by police officers within minutes after they drove a van into pedestrians on the bridge and then stormed pubs and restaurants, stabbing anyone in their path. Meanwhile, the sister of a missing 32-year-old man says he is believed to have died in the attacks on London Bridge and a nearby food market Saturday night. Melissa McMullan told Sky News on Monday that police said her brother James McMullan's bank card was found on one of the bodies after the attack, which claimed seven victims. She says authorities are unable to officially ID him until the coroner's report comes in. McMullan says her brother lived in Hackney in East London and was last seen outside a pub just before the van and knife attacks began. While our pain will never diminish, it is important for us all to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who wish to destroy us, she says.",____ Suspects in London Attack Named by Police

The new total: A hefty $860,000, reports the BBC. It's not exactly easy money, though: Defectors run risks including getting caught and sent home, and most often end up paying people smugglers exorbitant sums to get them to safety. This is the first such increase in two decades; the Guardian notes that the current sum is about $217,000.

So imagine the forensic scientist's surprise when 45 naturally preserved brainsâ€”shrunken to 20% to 30% their original size but with ridges still visibleâ€”were discovered in a mass grave in Spain. According to a study published in Science & Justice, the grave in La Pedraja contained 104 bodies of people shot and killed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The mass grave is one of only a very few of the hundreds from the war that have been excavated. Only 16 of the bodiesâ€”and none of the preserved brainsâ€”from the La Pedraja grave have been identified. There are a number of reasons behind the exceptional finding of the preserved brains, including the weather and manner of death. CNN reports it was colder and more rainy than normal when the victims were executed. Bullet holes in the skulls allowed rain water to seep in, but the skulls themselves kept the acidic soil away from the brains. This aided a process called saponification, in which tissue turns soap-like. While most other body tissues decomposed, the brains were preserved. Also preserved: the heart of a single victim, which Serrulla says is unprecedented. The 45 brainsâ€”the largest collection of naturally preserved brains in the worldâ€”are being kept in a laboratory in Spain.","____ Shrunken, Preserved Brains Found in Mass Grave"

And it's not pleasant community service either; duties include cleaning toilets at festivals and manually relieving sewer blockages. According to CNET, people may also be asked to give hugs to stray dogs and cats and paint snails' shells to brighten up their existence. UK WiFi company Purpleâ€”which handles WiFi hotspots for Outback Steakhouse, Legoland, and othersâ€”inserted the community service clause into its terms and conditions for two weeks to make a point about a lack of consumer awareness, Mashable reports. In a press release, Purple states it's unlikely to actually force community service on the 22,000 people who didn't read the terms and conditions (or, more worrisome, read the terms and conditions and agreed to them anyway). The company feels it's made its point. WiFi users need to read terms when they sign up to access a network, CEO Gavin Wheeldon says. Our experiment shows it's all too easy to tick a box and consent to something unfair.

But it wasn't their friendship Jelinajane Bedrijo Almario was after, say police in Hanford, Calif. Over the next few weeks in 2016, Almario, then just 16, pimped the girls, aged 14 and 15, by posting their photos on prostitution websites and driving them to meet clients at motels in Tulare County, Detective Richard Pontecorvo tells the Fresno Bee. Thankfully, we caught her case very early, he adds. Almario was arrested in May 2016 and charged as an adult with human trafficking and making terrorist threats. On Monday, two days after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. It was a huge eye-opener for us, Pontecorvo says of the case, heard in Kings County Superior Court. We were able to get these girls back home and get them the help they needed â€¦ but these pimps are ruining these kids' lives at an early age. Pimps like Almario, he adds, per UPI, are great at locating kids with low self-esteem and trying to be their friend, and then it obviously changes. For example, Almario once sent threatening emails to the mother of one of her victims who was simply looking for her daughter, reports the AP.

But as time ticked away to secure a bank loan for a permanent building for GracePoint Church, Lamb began to lose hope. One man donated $150,000, but the church needed twice that to meet the bank's terms, the Chicago Tribune reports. Then a woman offered up a gold $20 Double Eagle coin. The rare piece stamped 1866 was in the first series stamped with In God We Trust. The coin, one of 30, was never put in circulation. There are believed to be only 10 left, a rep for Heritage Auctions tells NBC Chicago. She estimates the coin could sell for more than $300,000 at an auction later this month. Honestly, we were completely stunned by the value of the coin, Lamb says. The donor, who requested anonymity, tells CBS Chicago she has all she needs. I can get by just fine. Iâ€™m not looking for wealth.

This after confirmation from a Fish and Wildlife Service official that the Trump administration intends to once again allow the import of elephant trophies from that country and from Zambia. A ban on the imports was instituted under former President Obama in 2014. ABC News explains the reasoning: Under the Endangered Species Act, the US can allow for such imports if there is evidence that the hunting actually bolsters the species' survival (elephants are on the endangered list). Officials from those two countries reportedly offered such evidence, though details weren't specified. The rule will cover elephants hunted in both countries through the end of 2018. The Humane Society shared its displeasure at the news: This jarring announcement comes on the same day that global news sources report that Mr. Mugabe, Zimbabweâ€™s aging dictator, is under house arrest following a military coup. This fact in and of itself highlights the absurdity and illegal nature of the FWS decision to find that Zimbabwe is capable of ensuring that elephant conservation and trophy hunting are properly managed. But ABC News reports the Federal Register notice on the topic that will be posted Friday says Zimbabwe has made strides on that front, such as creating a system that tracks the financial benefit provided by American hunters, who must pay hefty permit fees.

The internal report estimates that the cost will be $21.6 billion, around double the $10 billion to $12 billion figure President Trump cited during his campaign. The plan commissioned by new DHS Secretary John Kelly calls for construction of walls and fences in three phases over more than three years to have the barrier ready by the end of 2020, starting with 26 miles of wall in Texas and California. This would be followed by 151 miles of barrier in Arizona and Texas, then 1,080 miles to seal off remaining sections of the border, which already has 654 miles of barriers. The leaked plan does not reveal what the wall would look like, or what is going to be done in mountainous areas where construction would be unfeasible. Large parts of the border, especially in Texas, are in privately owned land and the cost of acquiring it, through eminent domain or other methods, is one reason for the soaring cost estimate. People's individual property will be condemned by the federal government for construction of the wall, researcher Denise Gilman tells the Arizona Republic. That's what happened in the past. And that's what would have to happen. Trump tweeted early Saturday that he hasn't gotten involved in wall design or negotiations yet.

In an April court case only now being reported, the former couple were ordered to pay $660,000 plus $70,000 in reputation-related damages after allegedly stopping payments to the designer overseeing a lighting update to their 17th-century property in Provence. Odile Soudant tells Liberation that Pitt sought her services in 2010 to ensure natural light flooded the 40-room Chateau Miraval, where Pitt and Jolie got married, per the Guardian. Soudant says she employed 17 people who worked on the project for months. But Soudant adds she was nearly driven to ruin when Pitt stopped paying. Lawyers claimed Pitt stopped paying Soudant because he believed she had demanded nearly $6 million. But a French appeals court determined the amount had been overstated.

Designs range from fairly standard (digital camo) to pretty out-there (unicorns farting rainbows). My ideas, they're either really random or based on what is happening right now, the Oregon high school junior, who has come up with more than 500 designs so far, tells KATU. The company's annual sales are more than $1 million, CNN Money reports. Agranoff has a number of part-time employees, and his mom works for the business full-time. One of his most popular designs involves pictures of the goats his family owns; Agranoff still has normal family chores, including feeding those goats, as well as his schoolwork. None of that stops him from working around 5 to 6 hours a day, he says. He taught himself how to code and do graphic design, and his parents were the first investors in his business, which he now runs from a 1,500-square-foot building on his family's property. Last week, HoopSwagg announced that it had purchased another custom athletic apparel company, its first acquisition. Agranoff plans to go to college eventually, but first he will work for his company full-time after graduating from high school six months early; he'd like to sell his products in brick-and-mortar stores.

TEST_83,"(Apr 9, 2017 12:49 PM CDT) The Oregon Legislature may have an unusual request for voters in the next election that harkens back to that fateful day in 1804 when a bitter rivalry between Vice President Aaron Burr and the nation's first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, was settled with a fatal gunshot. Should ongoing discussions in Salem materialize, voters would see a question on their general-election ballots asking if a 172-year-old ban on dueling by public officialsâ€”as in, the old-fashioned way of resolving fightsâ€”should be erased from the Oregon Constitution, reports the AP. The constitutional ban in question is Article II, Section 9, which says anyone who offers, accepts, participates in a challenge to fight a duel ... or who shall agree to go out of the State to fight a duel, shall be ineligible to any office of trust, or profit. The article was signed in 1845, almost 15 years before Oregon's statehood, when squabbles were still often resolved by duel even decades after Hamilton's death. They decided that it would not be very civil if two members of the Legislature disagreed and then shot each other on the front steps of the provisional capitol, GOP Sen. Brian Boquist said Wednesday during the bill's first committee hearing. Democratic Sen. Ginny Burdick jokingly called it the bill I've been waiting all session for. The sole public testimony came from Dan Meek, a Oregon Progressive Party rep, who opposes Boquist's proposal. This resolution would allow the candidacies of persons who give or accept challenges to fight duels, Meek wrote. Also, there is a cost to removing obviously unenforced and unenforceable provisions in the Oregon Constitution, including the cost of processing and printing this resolution on millions of ballots and processing the results.",Oregon May Ditch Its ____-Year-Old Ban on Dueling

A jury decided Wednesday that VR pioneer Oculus, which Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, infringed copyright and trademarks when it used code from games maker Zenimax to launch its own VR headset, the BBC reports. Zenimax had accused the company of stealing trade secrets, saying Oculus headsets were primitive before a former Zenimax employee used his insider knowledge to improve them. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg tells CNBC that the company is disappointed in certain elements of the ruling, but Facebook notes that while the jury found the company guilty of copyright infringement, failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement, and misuse of Oculus trademarks, it did not find it guilty of stealing secrets. She says the $500 million verdict, which Facebook is considering appealing, is not material to our financials.

CNNMoney reports Horizon Pharma's latest increase on Vimovo, which has seen nearly a dozen such rate rises since Horizon acquired it from AstraZeneca in 2013, amounts to a 9.9% increase on a 60-pill bottle, making the wholesale price $2,979. The high cost of the medâ€”which FiercePharma explains is prescribed to help ease symptoms from certain forms of arthritis and to prevent gastric ulcersâ€”is also raising eyebrows because its two main ingredients, naproxen (sold as the Aleve brand) and esomeprazole (commonly sold as Nexium), are sold separately for under $40. Based on the mechanism of action of these drugs, I see no reason why these products can't be taken individually, the CEO of a company that makes software to help ease drug payments tells the Irish Times. Horizon Pharma disagrees: It says taking the meds separately isn't the same as taking the combo pill; it adds there's no generic or OTC version of Vimovo. The company also pushes back on the steep price, noting it has rebates that allow all but 2% of insured patients to get the drug for less than $10 out of their own wallet. However, analysts say the price hike ends up raising insurance prices overall. It also underlies the murkiness of what happens when drug prices rise, as no one's really sure who's making money off the deal; besides the manufacturer, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are also in the mix.

Should another vacancy on the high court arise, Trump on Friday added five new judges to his existing list of 20 possible replacements, Politico reports. These additions, like those on the original list released more than a year ago, were selected with input from respected conservative leaders, the White House said in a statement that also noted Trump was elected to restore the rule of law and to Make the Judiciary Great Again. USA Today notes that Trump's move precedes the possible, but still unannounced, retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. Trump's initial list, released in May 2016, had 11 names on it; in September 2016 he added 10 more, and he ultimately chose Neil Gorsuch from that list to replace Antonin Scalia once he was elected president. The new judges added to the list are Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, Britt Grant of the Georgia Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kevin Newsom of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, and Patrick Wyrick of the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

The hurricane re-strengthened to Category 4 with maximum sustained winds near 130mph, reports the AP. The National Hurricane Center said Irma was expected to weaken but would remain a powerful storm as it moved through the Florida Keys and near the state's west coast. As of 5am EDT Sunday, the hurricane was centered about 40 miles south-southeast of Key West, and had sped up slightly, moving northwest at 8mph. Tens of thousands huddling in shelters watched for updates as the storm swung west, now potentially sparing Tampa as well Miami the catastrophic head-on blow forecasters had warned of for days. But those few miles meant St. Petersburg could get a direct hit, rather than its more populous twin across Tampa Bay. Neither city has suffered a major hurricane in nearly a century. The leading edge of the storm bent palm trees and spit rain across South Florida, knocking out power to more than 170,000 homes and businesses, as the eye approached Key West. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents in evacuation zones Saturday that this is your last chance to make a good decision. About 6.4 million were told to flee. Forecasters said the greater Miami area of 6 million people could still get life-threatening hurricane winds and storm surge of 4 to 6 feet.

The BBC reports that 11-year-old Ciro was the last of the three siblings to be pulled out of the debrisâ€”his 7-month-old brother, Pasquale, and 8-year-old brother, Mattias, were rescued earlier Tuesday, and it's said Ciro may have ensured at least one brother's survival by pushing Mattias under a bed in the family's home when the quake started. When everything crumbled, I hugged my brother, and then when the rescuers came, I pushed him out first, Ciro was quoted by the ANSA news agency as telling rescuers, via CBS News. I promised them that after this was all over we would all go get a pizza together, one rescuer told local media of the efforts to save the boys, which involved firefighters digging into the wreckage with their bare hands and sending water through a tube to the thirsty children.

Assad met with President Vladimir Putin on Monday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, in what was presented as a bit of a victory lap. I would like to introduce you to people who played a key role in saving Syria, Putin said to Assad in the presence of Russian generals; the BBC reports Russia has for two years been running an air campaign in support of Assad. At this point the Syrian government controls more than 50% of the country (earlier this year it was 19%), and as the AP puts it, no force on the ground is capable of driving Assad out at this stage. As such, Putin suggested Russia would be backing out, saying, Regarding our joint operation to fight terrorists in Syria, this military operation is indeed coming to an end. The AP notes Putin has made such pronouncements before and not followed through. The meeting preceded a summit in the same location with the heads of Syrian allies Russia and Iran, as well as Turkey, which has backed the rebels. CNN reports Putin said he would be calling President Trump on Tuesday to fill him in on the discussion. The AP notes that the eighth round of UN-sponsored peace talks between Syria and the opposition are slated to begin in Geneva, but no negotiated resolution is likely to lead to Assad's ouster.

For months there were texts, Snapchat, and Instagramâ€”she was told she was a loser, she had no friends. She was even told, â€˜Why don't you kill yourself,' the lawyer for the Grossmans says, per NBC News. But school administrators ignored months of pleas from her family to do something, the lawyer says, despite the fact that after the harassment started in October, Mallory started getting chronic headaches and stomachaches and her grades went down. Grossman's mother says the family spoke to teachers, guidance counselors, the vice principal, and the principal, and that while she was told the school was investigating, she felt her concerns were dismissed.

According to Credit Suisse's 2017 Global Wealth Report, the richest 1% now account for a record 50.1% of all global wealth, approximately $140 trillion, up from 42.5% in 2008. Meanwhile the poorest 70% of adults have just 2.7% of global wealthâ€”that's about 3.5 billion adults with less than $10,000 in assets each, the Guardian reports. The outlook for the millionaire segment is more optimistic than for the bottom of the wealth pyramid, Fortune quotes the report as stating. There were 2.3 million new millionaires created in 2017, bringing the total to 36 million millionaires worldwide. That's nearly triple how many there were in 2000. But the divide isn't just between the haves and have-nots; it's also geographical and age-related. Wealth in Africa actually fell by 1.9% per adult this year.

But as the Wall Street Journal reports, only 13% of workers in the private sector today hold pensions thanks to the 401(k) revolutionâ€”and original proponents of the tax-deferred savings plans are now saying they may not be the best way for people to shore up for their golden years. We weren't social visionaries, says Herbert Whitehouse, an ex-J&J exec who was also an early 401(k) promoter. Not only are the plansâ€”which let workers sock away pretax moneyâ€”vulnerable to stock market declines (defined-benefit pensions are guaranteed payouts for life), they're also subject to costly manager fees. And Forbes notes that longer-lived retirees may need enough funds to last 30 years or more, making it even more critical that retirement cash can be stretched for the long haul. One economist says at first she'd tell workers they'd be set if they saved just 3% of their salaryâ€”but that was based on projected 7% annual investment returns, an overly optimistic calculation. Plus, per an Employee Benefit Research Institute researcher, only 61% of workers who could be saving for retirement are currently doing so.

They have been paying for it with their lives ever since. An AP analysis of bird-killing programs at the New York City area's three major airports found that nearly 70,000 gulls, starling, geese, and other birds have been slaughtered, mostly by shooting and trapping, since the 2009 accident, and it is not clear whether those killings have made the skies safer. Federal data show that in the years after LaGuardia and Newark airports ramped up bird-killing programs, recorded bird strikes actually went up. Combined, the two airports went from an average 158 strikes per year in the five years before the accident to 299 per year in the six years after, though that could be due to more diligent reporting. At the seaside Kennedy Airport, which is on a major migration route and had a robust slaughter program before the Flight 1549 crash, the number of strikes has ticked up. Bird advocates say officials should find other, more effective ways to protect aircraft. There has to be a long-term solution that doesn't rely so extensively on killing birds and also keeps us safe in the sky, says a rep of GooseWatch NYC, suggesting better radar systems to detect problematic flocks.

The report, which DHS is said to have presented to congressional budget staff last week, notes that amount could get some signatures on contracts for wall prototypes, but it wouldn't cover breaking ground on any structures. Mic notes that, based on DHS estimates, the newly found reserves would pay for one whole mile of wall ; the US-Mexico border spans about 2,000 miles, per CNBC. Trump's wall plans, spelled out in a January executive order, stated that the US would pay for the wall with government funds and that reimbursement would later come from Mexico (though Mexico has said repeatedly it won't be paying a cent). Fox News notes that Trump initially said the wall would cost just $12 billion; he said at the time that wall-building would begin in just months. That timeline may need to be tweaked as the president likely goes to Plan B for making up the shortage: asking Congress for the rest.

But despite what he points out as missteps, as well as the contentious nature of Election 2016, Obama stuck by the assertion he made 12 years ago.

Something very strange has happened and I want to know what, says Annette Edwards. I've sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before. Things like this do happen, though, but rarely, reports the BBC. It cites US Department of Transportation data that shows 35 animals died in the course of air transport in 2015. Of those, United was responsible for the most of any US airline: 14. Edwards says Simon was bound for a very famous person's home. Simon himself registered somewhere on the fame scale, being the son of the world's largest rabbit, a 4-foot, 4-inch creature named Darius. Edwards says she expected the 10-month-old to ultimately take the title. TMZ reports Edwards sells the rabbits for $640 each, and spends 10 times that raising them.

Ronald Gray, a former Army soldier, has been on military death row at Fort Leavenworth since 1988. According to the Fayetteville Observer, Gray was convicted of killing five womenâ€”a cab driver, an Army private, a university student, a local resident, and a soldier's wifeâ€”and raping several others in 1986 and 1987 while stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. A civilian court gave him eight life sentences, but a military court sentenced him to death. All convicts on military death row must have their executions approved by a president. In 2008, George W. Bush authorized Gray's execution, but a federal court gave him a temporary stay. Last week, a judge ruled the stay was no longer in effect and denied any further stays. An execution date for Gray could be set sometime in the next month. He would be killed by lethal injection. Including Gray, there are currently six former service members on military death row. However, Gray is the only one whose death has been approved by a president.

Nurses and midwives met with her along the way, and before giving birth to son Earl Reese-Thornton Jr. on Dec. 2, 2013, things had been progressing well. The birth, she alleged in a lawsuit, was disastrous. Earl Jr. had to be revived after entering the world and suffered permanent severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The judge agreed Dr. Ata Atogho was at fault, with the verdict noting he left her room for extended spells, once to speak to his stockbroker for eight minutes; with fetal heart rate monitors indicating the baby was in severe distress, the doctor also should have performed a C-section but didn't. The $33.8 million Dixon and her child will receive as a result won't cost Atogho a penny. That's because he wasn't the one being sued; rather, the US government was, as it's liable for any injuries its medical employees cause, explains the Miami Herald. Not only does Dixon say Atogho never apologized, she also says he lied, something backed up by the testimony of a nurse who noted Atogho wrote refused c/s [that's C-section] in Dixon's medical records; on the contrary, the nurse testified she yelled, Just cut me. Local 10 reports the judge in his order cited a defense expert who says the child will live only nine to 12 more years. Though the head of Jessie Trice says Atogho is no longer connected to its centers, he has not been reprimanded and his Florida medical license is currently clear and active.

Thousands of fans lined the streets of Macon to honor the Ramblin Man, who was carried into Rose Hill Cemetery as a bagpiper played a somber tune. Family and friends, including musicians who played in The Allman Brothers Band over the years, gathered on a hillside overlooking his grave, which is shaded by huge oak trees. Many shared memories of concerts, and some blared the band's songs from their cars and trucks. One carried a sign saying You made our soul shine. We'll miss you brother Gregg. The funeral service was private, with room for only about 100 people inside the small chapel. Mourners, including Allman's ex-wife Cher, filed into the peach-colored building as five black stretch limousines waited outside for the short trip to the cemetery.

The procedure, which is FDA-approved, involves inserting one or two silicone balloons into the stomach through the mouth and filling them with liquid until they are about the size of a grapefruit. The balloons are left in the stomach for up to six months with the idea being they leave less room for food. All five deaths occurred within a month of the procedure, and three of them happened within three days of the procedure.

Jerry Brown holds up as a model for states and nations looking to lower carbon emissions. Brown's signature will add another decade of life to the state's cap-and-trade program, bolstering the Democratic governor's quest to portray California as a leader in the fight against climate change at a time when President Trump is pulling back, per the AP. Brown portrays the initiative, which would have ended in 2020, as essential for the survival of civilization. Extending it has been one of his highest priorities as he nears the end of his fourth term, but critics say it fails to aggressively combat pollution. The legislation was fiercely opposed by some environmentalists who say it's too timid for progressive California, especially those who work to clean up the notoriously smoggy air in parts of Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the agricultural Central Valley. Conservatives also fought the measure, saying it will raise costs in an already expensive state. But Brown and Democratic leaders were able to cobble together the two-thirds support needed in both chambers to extend the law through 2030. Cap and trade puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, getting to nine figures would be an auction record for a painting by an old masterâ€”that is, a European who painted before about 1800. But not just any old master: Leonardo da Vinci. His Salvator Mundi, or the savior of the world, is one of fewer than 20 da Vincis known to exist, and all the others are held by museums. It's currently owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who will likely be selling it at a loss. He bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million, and per his rep, the forthcoming auction of this work will finally bring to an end a very painful chapter. The pain he's referring to relates to Rybolovlev's dealings with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier, who counted Rybolovlev among his clients. Bouvier himself had purchased the work privately for $80 million; the 60% increase in price spurred allegations of fraud and ongoing court cases. But the drama began before then, with what Christie's calls the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century. It says it's known the painting belonged to both King Charles I of England and King Charles II, but the painting was lost from 1763 until 1900 when the workâ€”which had extensive repainting over Jesus' face and hairâ€”was purchased as a work attributed to one of da Vinci's followers.

His accomplice, Juan Laheraâ€”who reportedly yelled F--- you! at Howell as the latter panicked upon realizing his lack of water skillsâ€”evaded authorities until November, when he was arrested in Arizona and subsequently extradited to Broward County. Howell's body was found three days after Lahera, also 27 at the time, ditched him in the canal. During the robbery, the victim's dog was shot by Howell, notes the search warrant for Lahera. After Lahera got to the other side of the canal, he rushed to the roof of a local pizza joint, where he hid while calling a taxi to bring him to the apartment of a female informant.

A neighbor tells the Daily News Kevin's mother had a hard time lifting it off, eventually needing help from two people to free her son. Kevin was unconscious when emergency responders arrived and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A friend remembers Kevin as fun and nice. Police are calling the incident a tragic accident, and no charges are expected. But city inspectors are investigating. Many homes in the neighborhood have identical flower boxes, and residents are checking to see how well they're attached and keeping their children away from them.

I wish this on nobody, nobody, 36-year-old Elisha Cooke-Moore tells KTVL, which has a copy of her lawsuit filed last week. Cooke-Moore says she underwent genetic testing because both her mother and grandmother had cancer. The lawsuit claims Cooke-Moore was wrongly told the test showed she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome. She says she was told by gynecologist William Fitts that she had a 50% chance of getting breast cancer and an up to 80% chance of getting uterine cancer. She says nurse practitioner Lori Johns recommended surgery based on the test results. Months after her surgeries, Cooke-Moore says she was reading the test results for herself and says they were clearly marked negative, the Washington Post reports. Quite frankly, we are stumped to why they would make this mistake, her lawyer tells the Oregonian. The hysterectomy put Cooke-Moore into early menopause, and she says the botched mastectomy has required more than 10 corrective surgeries. She says she's been diagnosed with PTSD. It's terrible, she says. As a woman, they took what God gave me. I don't even feel like I am one at times.

A spokesperson for UNHCR says 31 survivors of two shipwrecks who arrived on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa reported that the rubber dinghies they were traveling in had capsized Wednesday in heavy seas shortly after leaving Libya. The first dinghyâ€”which carried around 140 people, including six children and about 20 women, some pregnantâ€”sank when wooden planks laid at the bottom broke, causing the dinghy to capsize 25 miles off the Libyan coast. Twenty-nine people were rescued, and 12 bodies were recovered. In a separate operation, two women found swimming at sea told rescuers that 128 other people had died in their wreck, the AP reports. UNHCR emphasized that the number of dead was an estimate. In both cases reported Thursday, most people on board appeared to have been sub-Saharan Africans. UNHCR said the increased number of deaths this year is partly due to the fact that smugglers are often using rubber dinghies, which are prone to deflating, capsizing, and losing people who fall overboard. In addition, more migrants are arriving with severe burns from being exposed to fuel mixed with sea water in the bottom of the dinghies. Smugglers are using rubber dinghies because they are cheaper and easier to obtain.",UN: Survivors Report 240 Dead in ____ Mediterranean Shipwrecks

Chris Baldridge tells the Washington Post that when Trump called a few weeks after his son, Army Sgt. Dillon Baldridge was killed, he told the president that he and his wife were struggling to deal with the fact that their son and two others were killed by a rogue Afghan police officer instead of in battle. Baldridge, a construction worker in North Carolina, says Trump offered him $25,000 after he complained that his son's $100,000 death benefit would go to his ex-wife instead of his parents, even though he can barely rub two nickels together. He said, 'I'm going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,' and I was just floored, Baldridge says. He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this.' But no check arrived in the following months, and Baldridge says Trump also failed to follow through on a promise to have his staff set up an online fundraiser. CNN reports that when asked about Baldridge's case Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the check has been sent.

The government-run Carlisle Indian Industrial School was established in 1879 as a place to scrub Native American children of their savage nature, a process that involved forcing new names, clothing, and language onto them. More than 180 are buried in a graveyard there, and the Northern Arapaho are now reclaiming the three children that are theirs. This week, more than a dozen tribe members arrived on the former campus in Carlisle, Pa., from Wyoming to oversee the exhumation of 14-year-old Little Chief, 11-year-old Horse, and 9-year-old Little Plumeâ€”or, as the school insisted the latter be called, Hayes Vanderbilt Friday. The children arrived at the school in 1881 and will soon return to Fremont County, Wyoming, for burial. PennLive reports that the US Army, the Army National Military Cemeteries, and a number of anthropologists and archaeologists are carrying out the five-day exhumation, which began Tuesday. There's a big X-factor, one archaeologist tells PennLive, in that the children were interred in wooden coffins, making the condition of their remains unknown. The process is being approached with great care: no machines, just shovels, hands, and mesh screens designed to sift out the smallest pieces of coffin or bone. The dead, many of whom couldn't withstand outbreaks of tuberculosis or the flu, hail from 50 different tribes, and future exhumations are expected.

Not only have researchers discovered a highly organized type of farming in Fiji antsâ€”who plant the seeds of fruit trees, fertilize and protect them, harvest the resulting fruits, and collect seeds for future plantingsâ€”but they report in the journal Nature Plants that the techniques date back 3 million years. Humans, by contrast, didn't begin to sort out how to plant and harvest crops until around 23,000 years ago, reports the Los Angeles Times. While farming has been observed in other species, including Yeti crabs that cultivate bacteria and sloths that grow algae gardens on their fur, this is the first time ants have been found to farm plants rather than fungus. Ants are a lot smarter than we think they are, one researcher tells New Scientist. We call them superorganisms because they form networks that are much like our brains. The information flow among ant colonies is just insane compared to human social systems. The researchers out of the University of Munich in Germany say they discovered that ant colonies have been seen farming dozens of Squamellaria plants simultaneously, all connected through trails that link the thriving domatia, which are round, hollow structures they form at the base of the fruit trees in lieu of nests. What's more, it appears that the ants and trees have evolved to be co-dependent; without the trees, the ants starve, and without the ants, the trees no longer propagate.

Nick Sweeting says he worked up securityequifax2017.com (a flip of the company's equifaxsecurity2017.com) to expose how easy it would be for phishers to make a copycat site. Their site is dangerously easy to impersonate, he says. Sweeting took pics of some of the now-deleted Equifax tweets, which started around Sept. 9 and went through at least Sept. 19, per Gizmodo. The company's critical error, per cybersecurity experts who spoke to the Times: It created an entirely new site instead of a subdomain of Equifax.com, making the company's site more vulnerable to phishing. Sweeting, who explains he was able to easily download the contents of Equifax's site using a Linux command, says his site got about 2,000 hits before getting the Twitter push, though he adds he built the site to not store consumer info, per CNN. He also made sure there was a large headline on the site alerting everyone it was fake. He says it cost him just $10 and 20 minutes of his time to create it. As for the person named Tim who tweeted out the wrong URL (who Sweeting thinks probably just Googled for the site address and picked up the wrong one), Sweeting doesn't think he should be harshly disciplined: The real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.

Even their dogs were affected, they say, with one urinating blood and another vomiting. We have been drinking the water for years and we had no idea, absolutely no idea, Debbie Higgins tells the AP. Few residents even knew the half-acre plot on Rennie Farm was used from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from tracer experiments, in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medical classes. Dartmouth cleaned the site up in 2011, removing 40 tons of carcasses and soil from unlined pits that were legal at the time they were dug. That led to the discovery of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive materials and evidence that at least one chemical used in experiments, suspected carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, had leaked into groundwater. It was found to have contaminated the Higginses' well 800 feet away at twice the state standard.

TEST_160,"(Sep 9, 2017 1:34 PM CDT) More than two dozen storage tanks holding crude oil, gasoline, and other contaminants ruptured or otherwise failed when Harvey slammed into the Texas coast, spilling at least 145,000 gallons of fuel and spewing toxic pollutants into the air, per an AP analysis of pollution reports submitted to state and federal regulators. The tank failures follow years of warnings that the Houston area's petrochemical industry was ill-prepared for a major storm, with about one-third of the 4,500 storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel located in areas susceptible to flooding, researchers say. The tanks are prone to float and break during floods, and Harvey's unprecedented rainfalls revealed a new vulnerability when the roofs of some storage tanks sank under the weight of so much water. An expert notes the storm surge was small enough, though, that refineries seem to have avoided the huge spills tied to storms like Hurricane Katrina, when ruptured tanks released several millions of gallons of oil. The reports also say air pollutants such as benzene, toluene, and xylene were released into the atmosphere. Long-term exposure to such pollutants can cause cancer, although Texas officials say they never reached concentrations high enough in the storm's wake to cause health concerns. More massive storage tanks could be put to the test in coming days as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida. Although Florida has no oil refineries, it has more than 20 petroleum product storage terminals in coastal communities and about 30 chemical companies with a presence in the state, including a significant number of facilities in the Tampa Bay area, per the American Chemistry Council and US Energy Information Administration.

The pedestrian was killed along with the tour bus driver and a passenger on the city bus, the AP reports. Sixteen other people were hurt, some of them seriously, in the crash at 6:15am in the Flushing, Queens, neighborhood, city officials said at a briefing.

An increase after President Trump's deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling by $318 billion leaves America $20.16 trillion in the red, up from around $19.84 trillion, CBS News reports. For comparison, Zillow estimates that the combined value of every house in the US is close to $30 trillion. Some $5.5 trillion of the debt is intragovernmental debt owed by one part of the government to another, with the rest held by the public. Michael A. Peterson, chief of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which calls for fiscally conservative policies, says passing the $20 trillion mark is the latest indicator of our nation's dire fiscal condition, the Hill reports. In a statement, Peterson warned that the growing debt will damage the economy and cost the government more than $6 trillion in interest over the next decade.

CBS says Ferrer died Thursday of cancer at his Los Angeles home. He was 61. He had played Assistant Director Owen Granger on NCIS: Los Angeles since 2012. Before that, he played the chief medical examiner and gruff-but-supportive boss to series star Jill Hennessy for the six seasons of Crossing Jordan. A native of Santa Monica, Calif., Ferrer was the son of Academy Award-winning actor Jose Ferrer and singer-actress Rosemary Clooney, and a cousin of George Clooney, who issued a statement Thursday afternoon.

CNNMoney reports Horizon Pharma's latest increase on Vimovo, which has seen nearly a dozen such rate rises since Horizon acquired it from AstraZeneca in 2013, amounts to a 9.9% increase on a 60-pill bottle, making the wholesale price $2,979. The high cost of the medâ€”which FiercePharma explains is prescribed to help ease symptoms from certain forms of arthritis and to prevent gastric ulcersâ€”is also raising eyebrows because its two main ingredients, naproxen (sold as the Aleve brand) and esomeprazole (commonly sold as Nexium), are sold separately for under $40. Based on the mechanism of action of these drugs, I see no reason why these products can't be taken individually, the CEO of a company that makes software to help ease drug payments tells the Irish Times. Horizon Pharma disagrees: It says taking the meds separately isn't the same as taking the combo pill; it adds there's no generic or OTC version of Vimovo. The company also pushes back on the steep price, noting it has rebates that allow all but 2% of insured patients to get the drug for less than $10 out of their own wallet. However, analysts say the price hike ends up raising insurance prices overall. It also underlies the murkiness of what happens when drug prices rise, as no one's really sure who's making money off the deal; besides the manufacturer, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are also in the mix.

He never exited the bus, Clark County's assistant sheriff said. Two people were taken to the hospital, reports the AP. One died, and the other was in fair condition. For hours, crisis negotiators, robots, and armored vehicles surrounded the bus with authorities uncertain if there were any more victims inside. Meanwhile, officers swept into casinos to warn tourists to bunker down, leaving these normally bustling pedestrian areas and a road notorious for taxi-to-taxi traffic empty.

Anthony Sanborn, 44, had been convicted of killing 16-year-old Jessica Briggs and sentenced to 70 years in prison. At a hearing earlier Thursday, Hope Cady testified that as a troubled 13-year-old she was pressured by police and prosecutors into identifying Sanborn, who was 16 at the time, as the killer. She said she was facing juvenile charges, and authorities threatened to send her away for years. She said she was legally blind when the murder occurred, meaning her vision wasn't good enough to have been able to see what happened, the AP reports. Officials say Briggs' throat was slit and she was stabbed repeatedly before being thrown in Portland Harbor. Cady testified that police and prosecutors told her what to say at trial and she had no knowledge of the killing.

A spokesperson for UNHCR says 31 survivors of two shipwrecks who arrived on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa reported that the rubber dinghies they were traveling in had capsized Wednesday in heavy seas shortly after leaving Libya. The first dinghyâ€”which carried around 140 people, including six children and about 20 women, some pregnantâ€”sank when wooden planks laid at the bottom broke, causing the dinghy to capsize 25 miles off the Libyan coast. Twenty-nine people were rescued, and 12 bodies were recovered. In a separate operation, two women found swimming at sea told rescuers that 128 other people had died in their wreck, the AP reports. UNHCR emphasized that the number of dead was an estimate. In both cases reported Thursday, most people on board appeared to have been sub-Saharan Africans. UNHCR said the increased number of deaths this year is partly due to the fact that smugglers are often using rubber dinghies, which are prone to deflating, capsizing, and losing people who fall overboard. In addition, more migrants are arriving with severe burns from being exposed to fuel mixed with sea water in the bottom of the dinghies.

We really are sailing in their (the ancestors') wake, said Murphy, 38. We had to re-learn what our ancestors had mastered. The voyage perpetuated the traditional wayfinding that first brought Polynesians to Hawaii centuries ago. Hokulea, which means star of gladness, was built in the 1970s, when there were no Polynesian navigators left. So the Polynesian Voyaging Society looked beyond Polynesia.

The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in Germany who, like Kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before Kathleen (and whose daughters Mike Peterson ended up raising). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, WRAL and the AP report. A new trial was ordered. The Alford plea entered by Peterson Friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict.

Bad news: The distribution of that new wealth was as uneven as ever. According to Credit Suisse's 2017 Global Wealth Report, the richest 1% now account for a record 50.1% of all global wealth, approximately $140 trillion, up from 42.5% in 2008. Meanwhile the poorest 70% of adults have just 2.7% of global wealthâ€”that's about 3.5 billion adults with less than $10,000 in assets each, the Guardian reports. The outlook for the millionaire segment is more optimistic than for the bottom of the wealth pyramid, Fortune quotes the report as stating. There were 2.3 million new millionaires created in 2017, bringing the total to 36 million millionaires worldwide. That's nearly triple how many there were in 2000. But the divide isn't just between the haves and have-nots; it's also geographical and age-related. Wealth in Africa actually fell by 1.9% per adult this year.

Activists have promised more protests against the acquittal of Stockley, who, during a police chase, was caught on dashcam video saying I'm going to kill this motherf*****, don't you know it, the AP reports. Less than a minute later, he shot Smith five times. Prosecutors accused him of planting a gun in the 24-year-old's car afterward.

CNN and the AP report that eight members of the country's emergency services team died when a National Search and Rescue chopper went down while on its way to help out.

Doctors were prepping her for cataract surgery, injecting anesthesia, when they found and removed the lenses. The woman, said to be in her mid-60s, hadn't complained of eye irritation, but she explained after the contacts were removed that she thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye, one specialist trainee ophthalmologist tells Britain's Optometry Today. When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses, she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable, she adds. The cataract surgery was delayed so that bacteria that had accumulated in part of the eye could clear. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, could offer a warning not only to contact-wearing patients who go long stretches without eye exams, but to optometrists as well, since the clump of lenses hadn't caused an obvious infection. If such an incident did lead to an infection, a person could lose her sight, the specialist trainee warns.

Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh, Cassandra Rivera, and Anna Vasquez were declared innocent after being wrongfully convicted of sexually assaulting two of Ramirez's nieces, then aged 7 and 9, in 1997 in what the state's expert witness then described as a satanic-related ritual. The alleged victims told police in 1994 that the women, who are openly gay, assaulted them at Ramirez's apartment but their testimony varied wildly, reports the San Antonio Current. Ramirez was later sentenced to 37.5 years in prison, while the others were sentenced to 15 years. Vasquez was paroled in 2012, while the others were granted bail a year later, after one of the two alleged victims recanted and the state's witness retracted her testimony. Earlier this year, a state district court judge overturned their convictions, which came at a time of anti-gay bias and national hysteria â€¦ over satanic sexual abuse, reports KSAT. But the judges on Wednesday found the woman, all in their 40s, have unquestionably established that they are innocent, and noted the father of Ramirez's nieces has engaged in a pattern of threatening behavior towards the complainants and false allegations of sexual assault.

But though he made as many as a thousand ascents that no one was known to have taken before, the German-born climber who immigrated to Seattle, Wash., as a child, avoided publicity and was virtually unknown to the general public, reports the New York Times. Choosing mountains over people (he never married or had kids), Beckey often climbed 50 peaks in a single year. In 1942, he and his younger brother, Helmut, wowed the climbing community with an impressive second ascent of Mount Waddington in British Columbia. He went on to accomplish hundreds of first ascents on peaks throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada, and Wyoming. In 1954, he established new routes on three of Alaska's mountains: McKinley, Deborah, and Hunter. Fred was a true American icon and inspired countless people to explore this amazing planet, says Dave O'Leske, who spent the past decade filming Beckey. Even in his 90s, Beckey was still plotting routes and climbing. Bond said they were planning a trip to the Himalayas next spring.",The Mountaineer We Never Knew Dies at ____

The singer and the billionaire Qatari businessman wed in 2012, and TMZ notes that the separation appears to have come exactly at the five-year mark of the marriageâ€”which could have financial implications if the pair had a prenup. Al Mana, 41, is worth significantly more than Jackson, 50, and prenups typically allot more money to the spouse the longer the marriage goes on; they usually include 5- and 10-year marks at which more money is doled out. Their new son, Eissa, could also have prenup implications, TMZ notes. Why the split? Page Six's sources are conflicted, with one claiming the split is amicable and the other saying Jackson thought Al Mana had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts. She also moved to London at his requestâ€”and her mother, Katherine Jackson, recently spent two months there with the family, which the source says is a factor in the split. Janet is worried about her mom, who alleges elder abuse at the hands of her nephew Trent, and the source says she's frustrated that her husband doesn't seem to share her concerns. The split news was reported soon after Katherine Jackson returned to LA. But TMZ says she may not actually have gone to London in the first place to get away from Trent, but rather because of the looming separation.","____ Months After Baby, Janet Jackson, Hubby Split"

The Iowa man was inspired to try his experiment after watching Supersize Me, the documentary in which eating McDonald's for a month led Morgan Spurlock to weight gain and worse health. But in Cisna's case, he kept to strict limitations: 2,000 calories per day, while sticking close to the recommended dietary allowances for fat, cholesterol, and nutrients. Cisna's students constructed their teacher's menu based on those guidelines, and the teacher didn't stick to just salads, oatmeal, and egg whites, although those were included: He typically ate traditional value meals for dinner, and tells KCCI, I had the Big Macs, the quarter pounders with cheese. I had sundaes, I had ice cream cones. The lesson? I can eat any food at McDonald's [that] I want as long as it's balanced out with healthier options the rest of the day. (It probably also helps that Cisna started walking 45 minutes per day during his experiment.) Says Cisna, who made a mini-documentary about the experience, It's [a] choice. We all have choices.

Divers used a remote-operated vehicle to confirm that they were in fact canal boats, but New York's historic shipwrecks belong to the people of the state and are thus protected from any unauthorized disturbance. Neither vessel has been ID'd, but the explorers date them to the mid-1800s, coinciding with the widening of the Erie Canal to allow for bigger boats, reports the AP.

A senior police investigator says the suicide attacker was wearing a military uniform. Dozens of ambulances raced to the scene after the blasts, and security forces blocked off roads leading to the area. A 34-year-old witness describes the scene of chaos he witnessed. The second explosion was so strong, and many people, including security officials, were killed and wounded, he says. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack in a statement, saying, The enemies of Afghanistan have lost their ability to fight the Security and Defense Forces of the country and thus attack highways, cities, mosques, schools, and common people. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid says his group had carried out the attack. The insurgents have been fighting to overthrow the US-backed government for 15 years, and they frequently target Afghan security forces.

Sarah Baughn filed the first complaint two years ago, her allegations of sexual harassment and assault at 2005 training classes hitting the Bikram world like an earthquake, as the New York Times puts it. But more followed, causing some formerly devoted followers to ditch their guru while others have blinders on and remain loyal, says Baughn, now 29. Some studio owners have gotten rid of the name Bikram, but simultaneously, new Bikram studios have continued to open. Baughn's case goes to trial in August. Another case involving a former student who says Choudhury raped her during a 2010 teacher-training will be allowed to move forward, after an LA judge this month cleared challenges from Choudhury's lawyers. And on Feb. 13, Canadian Jill Lawler filed a lawsuit also accusing Choudhury of rape at a 2010 teacher-training. She was 18 at the time, and says that Choudhury praised her during the training in Las Vegas, and that he first started groping her while she massaged him for hours. Afraid to say anything and feeling she had to complete the course, she says she continued on after an apology from Choudhury, but weeks later, Choudhury allegedly sexually assaulted her in his hotel roomâ€”and multiple times thereafter, up until February 2013, the lawsuit says. Choudhury denies all allegations.","____ People Have Now Accused Yoga Guru of Rape, Assault"

And even that was less than half what she was asking. The settlement includes cash and assets from her ex, Saudi businessman Walid Juffali, and is the largest in English history. This is what I am accustomed to, the Guardian quotes Estrada as telling the judge. It is difficult to convey the extraordinary level of luxury and opulence we were fortunate enough to enjoy. Estrada's initial request included annual payments of $152,000 for handbags, $780,000 for renting private jets, $107,000 for cocktail dresses, and more. The court says the final settlement meets Estrada's reasonable needs. Estrada, a US citizen, says she knows how all this is perceived in the wider world. Having grown up in a middle-class family â€¦ I am fully aware that the spectacular life Walid and I led was immensely fortunate and rarefied, the Guardian quotes the former model as saying in a statement.

Two years later, he divorced Estrada, again without her knowledge.

In the first public account of the incident, the official said the Russian Fencer flew within 1,000 yards of the USS Donald Cook, a Navy destroyer, at about 500 feet above sea level. Ship commanders considered the actions provocative and in violation of international agreements, prompting the ship to issue several radio queries and warnings. The fighter appeared to be unarmed and never was in danger of coming in contact with the ship, said the official, and the passes, which occurred in the early evening there, ended without incident. The USS Donald Cook has been conducting routine operations in international waters east of Romania. The ship, which carries helicopters, was deployed to the Black Sea on Thursday, in the wake of the Russian military takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region and ongoing unrest there. The official also said that a Russian Navy ship, a frigate, has been shadowing the US warship, remaining within visual distance but not close enough to be unsafe.

By a similar margin, those polled don't believe he has realistic solutions to the country's problems. Further bad news for the president include a 51% disapproval rate and majority perception that he's disconnected from the responders' values. This spells bad news for Democrats in the November elections, from which, Galston believes, they can't recover before the midterms.

China will initially receive 100,000 hectaresâ€”an area about the size of Hong Kongâ€”and increasingly acquire more over the next 50 years, the South China Morning Post reports. Quartz notes that 3 million hectares is 5% of Ukraine's total land, and 9% of its arable farmland. The total area China will eventually be farming is roughly the size of Massachusetts or Belgium. The land will be used mainly for growing crops and raising pigs, the Post reports, then the produce will be sold to two Chinese state-owned grain companies at favorable prices. The price tag on the deal is unknown, though a local newspaper reported last month that it would be more than $2.6 billionâ€”a unprecedented foreign investment for Ukraine's agricultural industry.

It may not be much of an exaggeration: The so-called Lady of the Cells faced many obstacles, reports the AP: a father who believed women should not study (she ultimately obtained a degree in medicine and surgery), a Fascist regime (Levi-Montalcini lost her neurobiology job in 1938 when Jews were banned from major professions), and the Nazis, whose 1943 invasion of Italy forced her family to flee to Florence and live underground. But the petite woman's determination was formidable: In the face of the Fascist regime she studied chicken embryos in a makeshift lab in her bedroom. She chose not to marry or have a familyâ€”without hesitation or regret, she once saidâ€”fearing doing so would weaken her independence. She claimed to sleep no more than three hours a night, and worked well into her final years. That effort produced contributions that were just as formidable.

Everyone's been operating in good faith and we hope to get it through the Legislature, Democratic state Sen. Mark Leno tells the AP. Gov. Jerry Brown sent the proposal to the Legislature on Monday, and it could be back on his desk as soon as Thursday. Under the proposal, the minimum wage would rise gradually, reaching $15 by 2022. After that, wages would rise with inflation, though in tough economic times the governor could delay increases. The minimum wage in California and Massachusetts is already $10 an hour, topped only by $10.50 in Washington, DC. I'm hoping that what happens in California will not stay in California, but spread all across the country, Brown told reporters at the state Capitol, per the Los Angeles Times.

The error came to light last year, when one of the mothers sued her former partner for child support. A DNA test done as part of the claim revealed the girl wasn't the man's babyâ€”nor was she the woman's daughter. Now, one woman wants her biological child back; the other doesn't want to switch. The decision will be up to the North Gauteng High Court, and Reuters reports that a court-appointed expert today sided with the mother who wants to keep the child she's been raising for four years. As Reuters explains, the court requested that the University of Pretoria's Centre for Child Law make a recommendation as to what would be best for the children, as South African law gives that a good deal of weight. After interviewing the mothers and fathers and clinically assessing the girls, the center's director advised that the children should stay with the parents who have raised them and should also be permitted to have contact with their biological parents.

The Vatican received the figure officially from local authorities and said it was a record, surpassing the 5 million who turned out for St. John Paul II's final Mass in the same park in 1995. Francis dedicated the final homily of his weeklong Asian trip to children. It was a reflection of the importance that the Vatican places on Asia as one of the few places where Catholic numbers are growingâ€”and on the Philippines as the region's largest Catholic nation. We need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed, cherished and protected, Francis said in his homily. And we need to care for our young people, not allowing them to be robbed of hope and condemned to a life on the streets. Francis made a triumphant entry into Rizal Park riding a popemobile, wearing the same cheap, plastic yellow rain poncho handed out to masses during his visit to the typhoon-hit city of Tacloban a day earlier. The crowdâ€”a sea of colorful rain ponchos spread out across 148 acres of parklandâ€”erupted in shrieks of joy when he drove by.

Another is that the average age of the voting cardinals is 72, which means many will likely get another chance to pick a pope before the cutoff age of 80. As for the concern that picking a 76-year-old raises the risk he will serve beyond his physical and mental abilities, Benedict's stunning decision to step down probably eased those fears.

The problem? The sign ceremonially renames Richards Street Seven in Heaven Way, and the NYC Atheists say that any reference to heaven on a government sign violates the separation of church and state. The problem with the sign is that you're assuming that you know what they felt deep down, says the group's president, who tells Fox News Radio that he might sue if it isn't removed. You're assuming they even believed in heaven. The attacks on 9-11 were an attack on America, adds the president of American Atheists, who has called for the sign to be taken down. They were an attack on our Constitution and breaking that Constitution to honor these firefighters is the wrong thing to do. But some city officials are peeved about the timing of the controversy. I think itâ€™s a little late in the process for someone to be bringing this up now, says one. And a rep for one city councilmember tells Gothamist, The seven heroes have long been known as the 'Seven in Heaven.' It is the way the community and their families chose to remember them.

Carlo Goias was charged under New Jersey's strict gun law, which requires permits for firearms, including the airsoft gun Goias used while filming a car chase scene. Goias rejected a plea deal offer Tuesday that could have sent him to jail for less than a year. He faces up to a decade behind bars because of prior felony convictions that prosecutors say include theft and burglary. I was shooting a movieâ€”I wasn't committing a crime intentionally, Goias says. Robert De Niro doesn't ask Marty Scorsese if he has gun permits. We're actors. That's for the production company to worry about. When he was arrested, Goias was playing the body guard of a drug dealer in the unfinished film Vendetta Games. The car chase scene was shot in a residential neighborhood, prompting several neighbors to call 911. I pretended to shoot out the window; they were going to dub in the sound later, Goias says. We get back, and within a couple of minutes we're surrounded by cop cars. Goias said he spent four days in jail as friends and family raised $10,000 for bail. Goias' defense attorney says his client is innocent based on his intent, which was to act in a movie, not commit a crime. Some state lawmakers say Goias' case highlights the need for New Jersey to change its gun laws.

Balhous argues that traditional budget math double counts $575 billion in Medicare savings, using it to both reinforce the Medicare trust fund and offset an expansion of Medicaid and insurance subsidies, the Washington Post explains. The White House dismissed Balhous' analysis, saying it departed from accounting rules used for four decades to measure budget impact. Opponents of reform are using 'new math,' one official said. But the CBO and Medicare actuaries have acknowledged the double-counting issue as legitimate. This isn't just a persnickety point, Balhous argues.

In a slow-moving roll call that mixed politics with pageantry, 236 lawmakers called out the Wisconsin Republican's name as their pick for the job. That assured that Ryan will become speaker, presiding over a chamber that has been awash in tumult ever since defiant conservatives hounded John Boehner into announcing his resignation last month. A sign of the tumult: Ryan is the first speaker elected in the midst of a congressional term since 1989, notes the New York Times. One other way his election is unique: At 45, Ryan is the youngest speaker since 1869, when 39-year-old Maine Rep. James Blaine took the job. Before the vote, Boehner bade farewell to his colleagues after a quarter-century House career, including the last five as speaker. I leave with no regrets, no burdens, said Boehner in a 10-minute speech. If anything, I leave the way I started, just a regular guy, humbled by the chance to do a big job. Boehner, a regular crier, got a standing ovation from members of both parties before he even started speaking when he pulled out a box of tissues. As the vote then proceeded, most of the hard-linersâ€”including members of the rebellious House Freedom Caucusâ€”backed Ryan.

Nearly five years after the disaster that dumped hundreds of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and killed 11 workers, Judge Carl Barbier is mulling details of the federal case against the oil company to assess a fine, which may reach a maximum amount of $13.7 billion, the Guardian reports. This next phase of the case against BP was reached after Barbier's September ruling that the spill was due to BP's reckless conduct, as well as his decision on Thursday that although 4 million barrels streamed into the Gulf, BP should only be held responsible for 3.19 million barrels thanks to its cleanup efforts, saving the company billions of dollars, the New York Times reports. Barbier's numbers are much lower than the government's estimate of nearly 5 million barrels of oil that flooded the Gulf, but still higher than BP's claim of 3.26 million barrels (2.45 million after cleanup), the Times notes. Each barrel carries a maximum Clean Water Act fine of $4,300, so the government's estimate could have meant an $18 billion penalty. Barbier indicated that differing data from both sides were voluminous, dense, highly technical, and conflicting, per the Times. There is no way to know with precision how much oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, he wrote. Although the Justice Department and BP are reviewing last week's ruling (with BP lawyers arguing that dropping oil prices should factor into the fine, the Wall Street Journal adds), an ex-prosecutor for environmental crimes tells the Times that the decision was a major victory for BP.",BP May Have to Pony Up $____B for Oil Spill

And though congressional Democrats and the White House are urging an extension, it's not looking likely, the New York Times reports. With Congress adjourning in two weeks, it remains unable to agree on a budget, and negotiators are focused on sequestration cuts.

On one side is Karl Roveâ€™s network, formed with fellow GOP operative Ed Gillespie; on the other, the operatives of the Koch brothers. The two groups came together for the 2010 election, but their relationship appears to be weakening, Politico reports. The first sign came this summer, when groups in the Rove-Gillespie network supported increasing the debt ceiling while Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed group, opposed it. Now, the two groups have launched dueling efforts to court Hispanic voters as well as competing voter databases. Ideological differences have always been apparentâ€”the Koch groups are more concerned with the free market and donâ€™t mind going after Republicans at times, while those in the Rove-Gillespie network are focused on electing Republicans for Republicansâ€™ sake, says one strategist. Nevertheless, they put those differences aside to run a highly-coordinated campaign last year, but insiders say that alliance may not hold for 2012. Koch intimates downplay the situation.

Those enduring the crucifixions aim to give thanks, atone for sins, or pray. After his 26th time on the cross, I feel good because my suffering has ended, said one man. But Filipino church leaders are opposed to the practice, in which shirtless men first trudge miles hitting their backs with sticks; some had cuts made on their backs to maintain a bloody appearance.

Yahoo's lossâ€”officially wrapping up the Jerry Yang eraâ€”translated into 22 cents per share, compared with a profit of 15 cents per share in the prior year, when Yahoo earned $206 million. Investors seemed relieved as shares gained 41 cents in extended trading, after finishing the regular session at $11.34, up 17 cents. The fourth-quarter setback wasn't as bad as it appeared because the loss stemmed from one-time charges of nearly $600 million related to restructuring.

That came to an end in 2010, and the AFP reports an urgency to their potential kick-start: Most of the relatives who would be reunited are quite old, and many have died. Indeed, the South held a lottery to select 100 participants in August, and two are now dead. One potential sticking point, however, is planned US-South Korean military exercises. Pyongyang says the exercises are aimed at a future invasion of the North and wants them canceled, but the South intends to hold them later this month.

Bresnan tells the Asbury Park Press that Kris was initially a student of his in a six-week prep class for the Series 7 exam; when they started commuting on the same Long Island Railroad train, he began by jotting notes to her on napkins.

The couple, who say they've never had a fight in all those years and prefer to talk it out instead of argue, call the collection their love diary. The signature of each letter bears an infinity sign. Some of the notes are short and sweetâ€” Thank you for being you and loving me, scribbled on a postcard in December 1989â€”but sometimes Bill goes big, reports ABC News. In the 50 days leading up to Kris' 50th birthday, for instance, he sent a series of 50 special cards.

In an effort to solve its 2012 mystery, Atlas Logistics Group Retail Servicesâ€”which operates warehouses that store products en route to grocery storesâ€”swabbed some of its employees to collect their DNA. Jack Lowe and Dennis Reynolds were two of them, and their DNA didn't match that taken from the poop, which had been found in the aisles and on canned goods. So they sued. Courthouse News Service reports that they cited the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which generally prohibits a company from asking its workers to hand over their genetic info. Last month, US District Judge Amy Totenberg determined Atlas did indeed seek and obtain such info as outlined by GINA, even though the test didn't disclose any medical details. She denied Atlas' motion for summary judgement, and the New York Times spoke to legal experts who believed this to be the only case involving GINA to go to trial.

A manhunt began immediately for the head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, believed to control most major crossing points for drugs at the US-Mexico border. Journalists near Altiplano prison, 56 miles west of Mexico City, said roads were heavily patrolled by Federal Police, who had set up checkpoints. Flights were also suspended at Toluca airport near the penitentiary. Guzman was last seen about 9pm last night in the shower area of the prison, the National Security Commission said early today. After a time, he was lost by the prison's security camera network. Authorities then found his cell empty. The escape is a massive blow to the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which has received plaudits for its aggressive capture of drug lords. During his first stint as a fugitive, Guzman transformed himself from middling capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world with a $1 billion fortune, and a Forbes World's Most Powerful People ranking.

Steve Bullock declared a state of emergency for two counties yesterday after a 12-inch oil pipeline burst Saturday, pouring up to 50,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River near the town of Glendive, the state's Department of Environmental Quality reports. Bridger Pipeline Co. noticed the breach Saturday around 10am and shut the pipeline down by 11am, per a company statement. A spokesman for Bullock initially told the AP that we think it was caught pretty quick and noted the frozen river may minimize damage. But cleanup crews are struggling through the ice, the AP notes. And although initial tests revealed no oil in the drinking water, residents started noting Sunday that they smelled something funny in the water; the EPA said in a statement last night that elevated hydrocarbon levels were detected in Glendive's water, the Grand Forks Herald reports. Drinking water is now being trucked into Glendive as a precaution, say officials; an advisory against drinking water from the local treatment plant was also issued last night, the AP notes. Officials had said earlier yesterday that contamination was unlikely because of oil's tendency to float (the water intake is nestled 14 feet below the surface). The DEQ notes a few oil sheens have been seen, with the AP reporting one 60 miles downstream from Glendive. In addition to the EPA and DEQ, the Coast Guard, Fish and Wildlife Service, and DOT are all assessing the mess and assisting with cleanup, notes the Herald. Our primary concern is to minimize the environmental impact of the release and keep our responders safe as we clean up from this unfortunate incident, Bridger VP Tad True said in the statement.

Inverted Jenny stamps are considered the most famous in America: A printing accident in 1918 produced a single sheet of 100 of the stamps, each featuring an upside-down Curtiss JN-4H biplane, NPR explains. In 1955, someone swiped a block of four from the collection of Ethel Stewart McCoy, whose father was a Dow Jones founder. It is one of the most notorious crimes in philatelic history, Scott English, administrator of the American Philatelic Research Library, tells the AP. The stamp was submitted this month to New York auction house Spink USA by an unnamed man in his 20s who hails from the UK and says he inherited it from his grandfather; it's unclear if he knew it was stolen. A press release from Spink USA states that the inverted Jenny was determined to be position 76 in the pane of 100 subjects â€”the one in the bottom right of the block of four stolen. Identification took some sleuthing: In a long-ago attempt to disguise it, the stamp had been reperforated at right and most of the gum was removed, so the pencil position numbers written on the gummed side had been lost. Positions 75 and 65 turned up in 1958 and 1982, respectively, and the new discovery leaves only one of the four stolen stamps unaccounted for. (In 2014, a dealer offered a $50,000 reward for the missing inverted Jennies.) The American Philatelic Research Library at the American Philatelic Society was given rights to the stamps by McCoy, who died in 1980, and is working with the auction house to take possession of the stamp.

The kicker: So far, he hasn't been able to evict the two official tenants, Burak Firik and Dogan Kimilli, WPIX reports. Landlord Eddie Shiew owns a three-story Queens home, and the person renting out the first floor alerted him to construction on the third floor. Shiew found that a construction crew had divided each bedroom into three bedrooms by putting up sheetrock. WPIX also investigated, and found people staying in the apartment who said they were paying $35 a night for a room after finding the property on Airbnb. Shiew brought in his own workmen to tear down the sheetrock dividers; he also changed the locks and told Firik and Kimilli to get out. But they went to court and got a court order against me, Shiew says. They said I illegally locked them out. The court agreed, ordering Shiew to let them back in. This time, instead of putting up sheetrock, the tenants allegedly used curtains as room dividers and continued to rent out rooms on Airbnb. Meanwhile, Shiew hired a lawyer and started eviction proceedings. He points out that the lease they signed bars them from making repairs or alterations, and his lawyer thinks the court will order them out within months. As Gothamist points out, Airbnb released anonymized data on their hosts last week to rebut allegations that many New York hosts are basically running illegal hostels, and said that just two Queens hosts had six or more listings on the site.

A teller mistakenly identified him as a robber who had been hitting area banksâ€”in a Heat cap. She set off the silent alarm, and things went south for Valladares, who was handcuffed by police and kicked in the head, reports the Miami Herald. This mistake quickly came to light: The robber was in his 60s and 145 pounds; Valladares was 46, weighed in at more than 200, and presented the check and driver's license, not a weapon.

Laurel Zuckerman is the great-grandniece of German Jewish businessman Paul Leffmann, who sold the 1904-5 work The Actor for $13,200, the Times of Israel reports. Leffmann and his wife had fled Nazi Germany for Fascist Italy the previous year. According to a lawsuit filed in New York on Friday, they sold the Picasso they had bought in 1912 at a discount to fund their escape to Switzerland. It was donated to the Met in 1952 by Chrysler heiress Thelma Foy. A lawyer for Zuckerman, who administers the Leffmann estate, says the painting is tainted by the history of the Holocaust, and the Leffmanns, given the circumstances under which they sold it, never lost title, Reuters reports. The New York Times reports that the museum says it has indisputable title to the painting and will fight the lawsuit. The museum says the price dealers in Paris paid for the Picasso was fair market value at the time and notes that the Leffmanns, who settled in Switzerland after the war, reclaimed some of the property they had been forced to sell but did not make a claim on the painting.

The proposals were given the initial go-ahead yesterday, and though more votes are needed, this is the furthest any state has gone to rein in teen access to cigarettes, the AP notes. Utahâ€”with the nation's lowest smoking rate at 12% as of 2011â€”is already one of only four states that require tobacco purchasers to be 19. The smoking rate is low in Colorado, too, at about 18%, but health advocates only want to see it fall. What I'm hoping to do is make it harder for kids to obtain cigarettes, says Colorado Rep. Cheri Gerou, while a Utah woman adds, By raising the age limit, it puts them in a situation where they're not going to pick it up until a much later age. A study last year found 90% of daily smokers have their first cigarette by 18, and 90% of those who buy cigarettes for minors are between 18 and 20.

The catastrophic prediction is from a new study published in the Nature Geoscience journal, the first study to look ahead at climate change consequences 1,000 years from now, the Daily Mail reports. Scientists say the actual effects could be even worse, since their study looked at a zero-emission scenario. Their study found that, in such a scenario, the northern hemisphere made out better than the southâ€”climate change patterns even reversed in places like Canada. But in addition to the ice sheet collapse, parts of north Africa dried out and became desert. One reason the southern hemisphere fared so poorly: Change occurs more slowly there, and the inertia in intermediate and deep ocean currents driving into the southern Atlantic means those oceans are only now beginning to warm as a result of CO2 emissions from the last century, says a researcher.",Sea Levels to Rise ____ Feet by Year 3000

That's the conclusion of a small new study that was a restaging of a previous one. As Science Direct explains, in 1938 an ad in a British paper invited Bolton Evening News readers to respond to the question, What is happiness? The 226 respondents were then asked to organize 10 factors by their happiness importance. Their top three, in order: security, knowledge, and religion. Last year, psychologist Sandie McHugh also asked Bolton residents, via the News, to fill out a questionnaire that mirrored the one used in 1938. Some 76 years later, things have certainly changed, at least according to the 489 people the News reports responded to the survey: Religion now occupies the 10th slot. While security holds on to a place in the top 3, it is joined by leisure and good humor, which the survey defined as more smiling and laughter for myself and those around me. McHugh observes that the overall impression from the correspondence in 1938 is that happiness factors were rooted in everyday lives at home and within the community, and that, too, has changed: While a majority once reported being happiest in their town, 63% of 2014 respondents said they were happier away from Bolton.

The latest attempt follows a Monday night attempt by 2,000 people to storm the area around the tunnel before they were repelled by police. A Eurotunnel rep tells CNN that some of the migrants were injured in the Monday night incident, and mass attempts to storm the area in Calais, northern France, are becoming an almost nightly occurrence. Calais is a key port for sea and land crossings to Britain. In recent months, thousands of migrants from Eritrea, Sudan, and beyond have camped out around the city. Some try to sneak across the English Channel by getting on trucks and freight trains. The encampments have soured relations between Britain and France, which blame each other for failing to cope with the crisis.

Scientists from around the world created the first data-driven global tree census by combining satellite images with tree counts from around the world, coming up with an estimate that amounts to about 422 trees per person, Gizmodo reports. The most tree-dense forests (nearly 25% of all trees) were in North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, while the most trees (more than 40%) were found in tropical and subtropical forests, notes Nature. Now here's why the grand total, though bigger than expected, isn't necessarily a cause for celebration. The study shows that approximately 15 billion trees are lost every year, and there are only about half as many trees as there were when humans first started farming 12,000 years ago. The scale of human impact is astonishing, Thomas Crowther, one of the researchers behind the count, says in Nature. We're not saying, 'Oh, everything's fine.' Gizmodo points out that trees are integral to providing the Earth with clean water and good soil while lessening the impact of carbon emissions.

John Kasich brings up the rear with 143 delegates. The next GOP primary is April 5 in Wisconsin, with 42 delegates at stake.

The massive Green Bank radio telescope in rural West Virginia will home in on each of the 86â€”chosen from 1,235 possible planets located by NASA's Kepler telescopeâ€”and collect 24 hours of data from each one, reports the AFP. The mission is part of the SETI project, which was forced to close down a major part of its efforts last month because of budget cuts. We've picked out the planets with nice temperaturesâ€”between zero and 100 degrees Celsiusâ€”because they are a lot more likely to harbor life, a veteran SETI researcher says.

A wealth of new Congress members and governors has Republicans buzzing over potential veeps like Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal and Kelly Ayotte, Politico reports. Where the potential presidential candidates are mostly white, male, and not from battleground states, the would-be veeps boast an impressive diversity when it comes to race, gender, geographical location, and political experienceâ€”and theyâ€™re young, with many under 50 and one under 40.

Thatâ€™s quite a difference from 2008, when the GOP was struggling with the aftermath of disappointing elections in 2006 and John McCain had few choices for a running mate.

The native of Knoxville, Tenn., was captured in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and held at German POW camp Staleg IXA, according to Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum. When the Nazis ordered all Jewish-American POWs to step forward on Jan. 27, 1945, Edmondsâ€”the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer at the campâ€”ordered 1,000 US soldiers to do so, regardless of their religion, per the AP. They cannot all be Jews! a German commander said, per Yad Vashem. We are all Jews here, Edmonds replied, adding soldiers didn't need to divulge their religion under the Geneva Conventions. The commander then put a gun to Edmonds' head. He said, 'I'll give you one more chance. Have the Jewish men step forward or I will shoot you on the spot,' Edmonds' son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, tells NPR. They said my dad paused, and said, 'If you shoot, you'll have to shoot us all.' The commander yielded. Chris Edmonds believes his dad's move saved 200 lives. Edmonds died in 1985 and his untold story nearly died with him. How it surfaced is fascinating: Some time after his father's death, Chris Edmonds read an article about Richard Nixon's purchase of a tony Manhattan townhouse from a man named Lester Tannerâ€”who mentioned that Edmonds saved his life. The son then embarked on a quest to find Tanner. Edmonds was honored on Wednesday as only the fifth American to receive the Israeli honor, the country's highest for non-Jews who undertook heroic acts in WWII.

Police say the boy was taken home to his family. A city transit official tells the CBC that the bus was being repaired and should never have been left unsecured. This is a case where policy and procedures were very clearly violated, he says. Buses are not to be left in that condition.

Colorado has enacted a few minor restrictions on guns since 1999â€”it's harder to carry concealed weapons, there are regulations on selling firearms at gun shows, and it's illegal to make straw man purchases for people who could not legally buy guns otherwiseâ€”but the state mostly prohibits local governments from restricting gun rights. Experts are, unsurprisingly, divided whether this latest example of gun violence will change anything. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have called for tighter gun controls. But just as Columbine and the shooting of Rep.

The trust of Carol Jenkins Barnett, daughter of the founder of the Publix supermarket chain, has donated $800,000 to the Drug Free Florida group, which is fighting a legalization measure on the ballot this November, the Miami New Times reports. Amendment 2 would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for what it calls debilitating medical conditions, including cancer, HIV, epilepsy, and PTSD, reports the SaintPetersBlog. A similar amendment failed in 2014â€”with Barnett's trust donating $540,000 to defeat itâ€”and the only Floridians who now have access to medical marijuana are children with severe epilepsy, who are prescribed a low-THC version, and terminal cancer patients allowed to use marijuana under an experimental drugs program, reports the Miami Herald. Barnett, 59, has early onset Alzheimer's and resigned from the company's board last month. Publix says her donation to the anti-pot group is personal and does not reflect company policy.

Antonio Marrero, 32, went to the emergency room of Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, where a doctor determined he had an abscess in his tonsils and arranged for him to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist, lawyer Richard Fried said. The doctor then decided to further evaluate him under sedation, but Marrero lost consciousness and died, Fried said. Before sedating him, the doctor should have known Marrero weighed nearly 300 pounds, which would make it difficult to protect his airway, the lawsuit filed by Fried notes. There was no anesthesiologist there, and the doctor gave Marrero too much of the sedative, Fried said. At a news conference to announce the settlement, Marrero's wife, Rachel, recalled her shock when she was told the father of her three young sons had died. She told health center workers, He just had a sore throatâ€”what do you mean he passed? After the presser, the health center's execs hugged her and offered condolences; they declined to disclose the ER doctor's name, but the suit named Dr. Robert Bonham.

According to USA Today, Target suffered some backlash last spring when it announced it would allow transgender customers to use the restroom ... that corresponds with their gender identity. In the wake of that backlash, the company announced this week it will install a third, single-person restroom to the few hundred US stores that don't already have one by March 2017. The single-occupancy restrooms can be used by anyone. At the end of the day, Target is all about inclusion, a Target spokesperson tells CNN. We want everyone to feel comfortable in our stores. However, Target will still maintain its restroom policy for transgender customers. And that's a problem for groups like the American Family Association, whose spokesperson tells the Wall Street Journal it will continue to be a bathroom free-for-all at Target. The AFA claims more than 1.3 million people have signed an online petition to boycott Target. While Target has seen a 7% drop in sales this year, CFO Cathy Smith says that's not due to the boycott. She also says the addition of third restrooms to all Target stores was not a response to the boycott but something Target CEO Brian Cornell had already planned. Regardless, Target's announcement Wednesday was hailed by the National Center for Transgender Equality.",Target Hopes $____M Will Solve Transgender Bathroom Problem

Police say the gunman was 22, born in Denmark, and was known to law enforcement as having been involved in gangs. Officials say it is possible he was imitating the terror attacks last month in Paris. Denmark has been hit by terror, Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt said today. We do not know the motive for the alleged perpetrator's actions, but we know that there are forces that want to hurt Denmark. They want to rebuke our freedom of speech. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu decried the attack and said his government plans to encourage a massive immigration of Jews from Europe. Again, Jews were murdered on European soil just because they were Jews, he said today. Denmark's Chief Rabbi, Jair Melchior, identified the Jewish victim as Dan Uzan, 37, a longtime security guard for the Danish Jewish community. He was guarding a building behind the synagogue during a bat mitzvah when he was shot in the head. Two police officers there were slightly wounded. Later, the shooter was confronted by police as he returned to an address they were keeping under surveillance. Investigators described him as 25 to 30 years old with an athletic build and carrying a black automatic weapon. Lars Vilks, the 68-year-old artist who has faced numerous death threats for depicting Muhammad as a dog in 2007, said he believed he was the intended target of the first shooting, at a panel discussion titled Art, blasphemy and freedom of expression.

That's what a firefighter in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recorded telling a 911 caller after a 17-year-old was shot at a party. The exchange involved Albuquerque Fire Department driver Matthew Sanchez, who was working dispatch on the night of June 26. In a roughly 30-second portion of the recorded call, posted by KRQE, he's heard twice asking if Jaydon Chavez-Silver was breathing. The caller responds, Heâ€™s barely breathing. How many times do I have to f---ing tell you? to which Sanchez replies that he isn't going to deal with this and then hangs up. Jaydon later died from the gunshot, per KRQE. The fire chief on Monday said Sanchez was immediately removed from the dispatch center and placed on administrative assignment. An internal investigation has been initiated. Chief Administrative Officer Rob Perry subsequently announced that Sanchez had resigned from the Albuquerque Fire Department, where he had worked for 10 years, reports KOAT. KOB6 reports that police believe the shooter either walked or drove by the home where about 10 people were gathered and fired as many as six shots; no arrests have been made. KRQE notes Jaydon had only been at the home for about five minutes before the shooting began.

But how Northup died remains a mystery that historians are still trying to solve, the AP reports. To recap, Northup was living with his family in upstate New York when two white men lured him to Washington, DC, in 1841, kidnapped him, and sold him into slavery in New Orleans. He survived 12 years on a Louisiana cotton plantation before friends sprung him, and he went on to publish a memoir and help escaped slaves attain freedom via the Underground Railroad. But around 1863, he vanished. Was he killed as a Union Army spy? Did he hit the bottle and get kidnapped again? Or did he just die someplace where a black man wouldn't get a proper burial during the Civil War? Historians have heard or surmised such versions of Northup's death, and one author, David Fiske, checked cemeteries and death records but came up empty. He may have just wandered around from place to place and died somewhere nobody knew who he was, and he was buried in a potter's field, said Fiske. But Northup's descendents tell USA Today that they're more focused on his accomplishments: Every challenge and obstacle that I do have, is somewhat nothing compared to his, so there is no reason that I can't accomplish or get past it, says Northup's great-great-great-great-grandson.",____ Years a Slave Writer: Killed as Union Spy?

A total of 43 people, including one police officer, were killed in the confrontation in the western state of Michoacan on May 22, 2015. The National Human Rights Commission says five people were killed when a police Black Hawk helicopter fired 4,000 rounds at the ranch house after the officer was shot, the BBC reports. Another 22 were arbitrarily executed, while the circumstances of the other 15 deaths are still unclear, according to the commission. The lopsided death toll had led to suspicions that officers might have arbitrarily killed people during the operation against suspected members of the Jalisco New Generation cartel. Eighteen of the victims were found barefoot and one just in his underpants, leading the commission to conclude most were asleep when police arrived. Thirteen of the 22 people the commission says were executed had been shot in the back.

Through the school, the ex-Buckeyes coach said that he is taking responsibility for the NCAA inquiry, which developed after it was learned Tressel failed to report players receiving improper benefits. The university also is putting the football program on probation for two years, which means there would be harsher penalties if any further wrongdoing is discovered.

So she decided to comb through the leaked data herself to find out. What she discovered wasn't pretty. It's like a science fictional future where every woman on Earth is dead and some Dilbert-like engineer has replaced them with badly designed robots, Newitz writes. As near as she could figure, as few as 10,000 of the female user profiles belonged to real women who had ever done anything with their account. The overwhelming majority of men using Ashley Madison weren't having affairs, she writes. They were paying for a fantasy. While hunting for fake profiles within the leaked data, Newitz looked at things like email and IP addresses and last names. These turned up a potential 80,000 likely fake female user accounts. She then looked at what the women were doing on the siteâ€”or weren't. Of the 5.5 million female users, fewer then 10,000 had ever responded to a message and fewer than 1,500 had ever checked their inbox. That's an activity rate of near 0%. Perhaps the truest sign of human female activity Newitz could find was the 12,108 female user accounts that someone had paid to delete.

The Review is most steamed about Holderâ€™s role in the final corrupt act of the Clinton administration: the pardons issued in the departing Presidentâ€™s final hours, including that of financier Marc Rich.

Blaine Gibson, who says he's been searching for Flight 370 over the last year, tells the AP that he had wanted no publicity about his Feb. 27 discovery until after the piece was assessed by investigators, but that news of the finding leaked. He says he is cautious about the possibility that the part is from the missing Boeing 777 because three large jets had crashed in the area before. Regardless, Gibson says he hopes his finding will encourage more people in the area to comb beaches for clues and to hand over any items they think could be passenger belongings or plane debris. The new piece of debris is now in the hands of Mozambique civil aviation authorities and is expected to be sent to Australia this coming week to be examined. The Malaysian transport minister says there is a high probability that the part found off Mozambique is from a Boeing 777. Flight 370 is the only missing 777. And Australia's transport minister says the location of the debris matches investigators' drift modeling. Gibson says he decided to look for plane debris after a week of sightseeing in Mozambique. A tour guide told him the sandbank was where fishermen went to look for rope that washed up from the open ocean. He says the tour guide spotted the piece of debris after about half an hour of searching.",US Adventurer Who May Have Found Part of MH____ Would Be 'Lucky'

The lawsuit from songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard alleges Sheeran's Photograph is too similar to their 2009 song Amazing, released by X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012. They're represented by the same heavyweight lawyer who, for the family of Marvin Gaye, nabbed $5.3 million plus 50% of publishing and songwriting rights from Robin Thicke's monster hit, Blurred Lines. In addition to similar chords, the plaintiffs say 70% of Sheeran's chorus is identical to Amazing in pitch, rhythmic duration, and note placementâ€”and plenty on social media seem to agree, reports Billboard. The similarity of words, vocal style, vocal melody, melody, and rhythm are clear indicators and are instantly recognizable to the ordinary observer, the complaint reads, per the BBC, adding the alleged infringement is breathtaking in its deliberateness, magnitude, and hubris. The plaintiffs say they tried to settle the dispute privately before filing the suit, which also names co-writer Johnny McDaid of band Snow Patrol, Warner Music, and others, per the Guardian. They're seeking $20 million plus royalties. After Photograph was released in 2014, Sheeran rightly predicted it would change his career.

The riot, only three years after similar violence killed 74 people, began ahead of a match between Egyptian Premier League clubs Zamalek and ENPPI at Air Defense Stadium east of Cairo. Such attacks in the past have sparked days of violent protests pitting the country's hard-core fans against police officers in a nation already on edge after years of revolt and turmoil. Three security officials said some people died during a stampede, while others died in clashes with police. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists. What caused the violence wasn't immediately clear. Security officials said Zamalek fans tried to force their way into the match without tickets, sparking clashes. Zamalek fans, known as White Knights, posted on their group's official Facebook page that the violence began because authorities only opened one narrow, barbed-wire door to let them in. They said that sparked pushing and shoving that later saw police officers fire tear gas and birdshot.

Now scientists say the Sierra Nevada snowpackâ€”which gives the state nearly a third of its surface waterâ€”is at a shocking 500-year low, the Guardian reports. That means California, now in its fourth year of drought, can't rely as much on winter snow accumulation in the mountains to fill streams and reservoirs during the hot summers. It was unprecedented, says Valerie Trouet, who led the study published in Nature Climate Change. When you are a climate scientist, first you get excited by the result. Then you realise the extreme level of the snowpack is not something to get excited about. Trouet's team reached their conclusion by analyzing rings in the trunks of 1,500 blue oak trees in the region, CNBC reports. Winter precipitation plays a big role in the trees' growth, she says, which can be measured by the width of each year's ringâ€”and last year's was pretty darn thin. So how did it get this bad? Seems that last winter's record-high temperatures and lack of rain led to the dismally low snow accumulation. Trouet also warns that California's uncontrollable wildfires can be linked to the lack of Sierra Nevada snowmelt, which scientists had already figured was at a 100-year low.

Her diagnosis inspired Lewis to make the most of every day, because I know my time is limited, she says. So, with her doctor's permission, she set a goal: Try out for the Saintsations. Honestly, I really did not think I was going to make the cut, she tells the AP. But, the squad's director tells the Sun-Herald, it was a unanimous decision to put her on the team. ... When she needed to blend with the others, she did, and when she needed to stand out, she did. She was the oldest person ever to audition for the team, and her competition was made up mostly of women ages 18 to 28. Because the applications weren't processed before the dance auditions started, the judges didn't even know Kriste was 40 until she had made it through three rounds of cuts and revealed her age in the interview round, the director says. Lewis, who was a high school cheerleader and is currently a dance instructor, is one of just two NFL cheerleaders in her 40s; the other, Laura Vikmanis, is 45 and has been dancing with the Cincinnati Bengals Ben-Gals since age 40.

There are 10 bug classes eligible: Cross-site scripting bugs, for example, are worth 50,000 miles, while authentication bypass bugs earn 250,000. While passively poking the site, Jordan Wiens, founder of a Florida security company, says he found what he thought were two remote code execution bugs, which allow a hacker to run their own potentially dangerous code on a site. I also thought they were lame and wasn't sure if they were on parts of the infrastructure that qualified, he tells Threatpost. I figured they'd award me 50,000 miles or something smaller. It turns out RCE bugs earn the highest payout: a maximum 1 million miles.

I do the show the way I think it should be, not the way somebody tells me it should be, Jacobs told the New York Times after his Manhattan presentation. There is no controversy. Health initiative guidelines set by the Council of Fashion Designers of Americaâ€”which includes Jacobs on its boardâ€”recommend that runway models be at least 16 years old. The age limit has been touted as a sign of progress in an industry plagued by anorexia. The industry's hiring of prepubescent-appearing teenage girls as models of adult clothing sets an unrealistic standard; the curves that define the female figure are absent, said council president Diane von Furstenburg. Models who attempt to maintain a child's body into adulthood run the risk of eating disorders, she warned. The girls in Jacobs' show, Thairine Garcia and Ondria Hardin, are represented by Ford Models, which apparently also ignores the council's recommendations. While Ford supports the idea of health initiatives, it hasn't agreed to an age limit, reports ABC. Even the council itself said it's ultimately up to a designer. What's curious is why Jacobs decided to use the girls in designs that largely covered them up, and shadowed them with large hats.

Sonnenfeld insisted she killed herself, but prosecutors filed murder charges against himâ€”only to drop them five months later. Then they charged him again in 2003, before discovering that he had moved to Argentina. The case involves the intricacies of forensics, theories about gun angles, a possible suicide note, and now international borders. But as a lengthy piece in GQ explains, that's only the half of it. It was only in Argentina that Sonnenfeld's work as an official videographer at Ground Zero for the federal government entered the picture. Sonnenfeld, with the help of his new wife in Argentina, has over the years become a media superstar in the country by championing the idea that the US knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. Among other things, he argues that he was summoned by FEMA suspiciously fast, and he speculates about why a vault found in the wreckage was emptyâ€”FEMA must have emptied it in advance. So, sure, he sounds like a crackpot. But his advocates say that the US government wants to have him extradited on the murder charges so he can be silenced through execution. If the truther-ism is a ploy, it seems to be working: The Argentine government refuses to extradite him, even though Denver authorities say they're not interested in the death penalty. One camp in this affair portrays Sonnenfeld as a devious murderer, while the other paints him as a persecuted whistle-blower, writes Evan Hughes at GQ. But it is possible that neither is true: Even if you believe that Sonnenfeld made up a lunatic story in a desperate plea for Argentine protection, you can still believe that he's innocent of the crime.

But the treatment appears to have come with some serious complications. Xu had more recently been suffering from new pains in his back and chest, Fox News reports. Every time I went to a doctor, they said it was just old age, Xu says. The real culprit, it seems: an inch-long needle left over from the treatment. Doctors in China found the needle through X-rays. They told me there was a foreign body in my stomach, and I just panicked, thinking it was cancer, Xu says. You can imagine my shock and relief when they told me it was the acupuncture needle. Health workers think the thing was traveling through his body as he moved over the years, the Daily Mail reports. A doctor says it ended up in his intestines, and it had turned black and was very thick because of decades of oxidation. Now, the 60-year-old says he's cured.

On Wednesday, a Florida circuit court judge declined to order a new trial or change the jury's verdict in Hogan's lawsuit against the media company, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Gawker's attorney had asked the judge to reduce the jury's verdict or toss it completely. In March, Hogan was awarded $55 million in economic damages, $60 million for emotional distress, and $25 million in extra punitive damages after Gawker published a portion of his sex tape in 2012, according to ABC News. Gawker has said paying that amount would be ruinous for the company, the Wall Street Journal reports. A lawyer for the company calls the verdict grossly excessive compared to the conduct at issue. Hogan's team disagrees.

A new study from Texas A&M Transportation Institute and INRIX finds drivers are spending more time in traffic than ever before. In 2009, drivers wasted about 6.3 billion hours on the road, reports ABC News. The average delay has actually doubled since 1985 and it's only going to get worse: By 2020, the study authors predict the average driver will face 47 hours of delays for a combined 8.3 billion hours nationwide, reports USA Today. That number will probably look good to anyone who drives in Washington, DC, though. The capital had the worst traffic in the country, with drivers wasting 82 hours of their time. Los Angeles (80), San Francisco (78), New York (74), and San Jose (67) rounded out the top five.

Attorney Jay Norton tells the AP that six of his clients were indicted on Tuesday despite what seems to be a serious lack of evidence. This is amazing and truly scary, he says. We do not understand what the district attorney's office is doing, but it's not about reality. The AP notes that the last person arrested in connection with the shootout got out of jail last week on $50,000 bond.

Family members say Ming Dong Chen, who came to the US in 2004, had been unable to hold down a job and had been moving around the US for years, staying with the Brooklyn family on and off. He's crazy, a cousin of the murdered woman says. He came here illegally from China. He was living with them. He's not stable. Chen, 25, was arrested at the cousin's Brooklyn home after the wife called relatives to say he had been acting strangely. They arrived at the home to find Chen covered in blood. Inside, police found the bodies of Qiao Zhen Li, 37, and her children Linda, 9; Amy, 7; Kevin, 5; and William, 1. After his arrest, he made statements implicating himself, the police source says.

The Democrat, his views shaped by the Great Depression and FDR's policies, fought hard for the rights of workers during a political career that began in 1943. Colleagues nicknamed the self-made millionaire Senator No after he used his mastery of Senate rules to block special interest bills and save taxpayers billions. His tough stance against pork-barrel politics won the proudly liberal and often curmudgeonly Metzenbaum plenty of foes, but he gained their grudging respect as well.

TEST_615,"(Feb 24, 2015 1:24 PM) In case you weren't convinced of the dangers of smoking, a new study offers a stark figure: Up to two-thirds of those who continue smoking will die as a result, researchers say in a press release. The Australian study was a big one, based on assessments of the health of 200,000 people over four years; the men and women are part of the southern hemisphere's biggest longitudinal study on aging, the release notes. We found that smokers have around threefold the risk of premature death of those who have never smoked, says researcher Emily Banks. We also found smokers will die an estimated 10 years earlier than non-smokers. That was true for both men and women, Banks says, as the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The two-thirds figure supports similar results from the UK and US. The average smoker in the study kept up the habit for 38.5 years, and the majority smoked at least 15 cigarettes daily. That's particularly worrying given that mortality rates were about twice as high in those smoking around 10 cigarettes per day. A pack a day means death rates fourfold or fivefold what a nonsmoker experiences, the study finds. Our findings are an important reminder that the war on tobacco is not yet won, and tobacco control efforts must go on, Banks notes. Looking on the bright side, the study shows it's never too late to quit, no matter what your age or how much you smoke, says another expert, as HealthDay News reports.

Ved says he doesn't know exactly what caused the glitch on Google's end, but he details the geekily sordid affair on his LinkedIn account. CNET speculates that Google missed a renewal deadline, and Ved was able to capitalize.

The level of small plastic pieces in the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch has increased 100-fold over that span, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found in a new study. We did not expect to find this, one researcher tells the BBC. To find such a clear pattern and such a large increase was very surprising. Leave plastic in the ocean long enough and it'll break down into small easy-to-swallow piecesâ€”an earlier study indicated that 9% of fish have plastic in their stomachs. There's another environmental consequence, too: Marine insects called Halobates sericeus, or sea skaters, have been using the plastic as a place to lay eggs, so their population is exploding in the region and could impact plankton and fish eggs, which they feed on. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a Texas-sized area, born from ocean currents that conspire to assemble trash and detritus, MSNBC explains.",Plastic in Pacific Has Grown 100-Fold Since ____s

Late nights will likely feature a talk show in the mold of The View, airing at 11pm. And the network is currently searching for new personalities who aren't necessarily from the world of news; Bourdain, the New York Post reports, is the prototype. Another change: CNN is ready to take on outside producers for its shows, something it's never done in the past. It's like that moment when MTV decided to stop playing music videos, because it wasnâ€™t working more, says an insider.

I don't like seeing it. Yes, I think it's pure political correctness, Trump tells Today, per Politico. Jacksonâ€”who many condemn for owning slaves and removing Native Americans from their landsâ€” had a history of tremendous success for the country and should stay put on the bill, Trump continues. (Jackson is to be moved to the back of the bill.) Tubman was fantastic, but would be more appropriate on the $2 bill or some other denomination, Trump adds. He was actually repeating an idea of Ben Carson's. I love Harriet Tubman. I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill, he said Wednesday on Fox Business, per Politico. He added Jackson was a tremendous president and the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt. Hillary Clinton had a different take.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta signed a deployment order today en route to Turkey from Afghanistan, a rep says. The order calls for 400 US soldiers to operate two batteries of Patriots at undisclosed locations in Turkey. Turkey is a founding member of NATO and requested that the alliance provide Patriots. They will be sent by NATO members Germany and the Netherlands as well as the US for an undetermined period. During a brief stop at Incirlik Air Base, some 60 miles from the Syrian border, Panetta told US troops that Turkey might need the Patriots, which are capable of shooting down shorter-range ballistic missiles as well as aircraft. He said he approved the deployment so that we can help Turkey have the kind of missile defense it may very well need to deal with the threats coming out of Syria, he said.

But for Henry Rayhons, a former Republican legislator in Iowa, it's a trickier case. The 78-year-old is currently on trial, charged with felony sex abuse for allegedly having sex last May with his wife, Donna, in a nursing home a few days after he was told she wasn't able to consent to intimate relations, the New York Times reports. Donna, who died in August, suffered from dementia, with nursing home staff noting she no longer remembered her daughters' names, how to recall everyday words, or how to eat certain foods. You could see that Donna had Alzheimer's. ... She was just in her pleasant little world, a nurse from Concord Care Center testified yesterday in Garner, per the Quad-City Times. The center allows residents to have consensual sex, but Henry, who wed Donna in 2007, was told in a May 15 sit-down with center staff and Donna's daughters that Donna was unable to consent to sex due to her deteriorating mental state, KIMT reports. On May 23, Donna's roommate complained about Henry's visit, and a surveillance camera shows Henry leaving the room that day and dropping what's reported to have been Donna's underwear in a hamper; Henry was arrested shortly after his wife died a few months later. Although experts cited by the Times suggest dementia patients can benefit from such intimacy, Dr. John Brady, the nursing home's physician, compared a patient's receptive responses to sexual advances to those of a baby responding to love from its mother, the Des Moines Register reports.

Owners will get a $500 debit card that can be used on anything, plus $500 in the form of a VW credit, notes USA Today. The offer announced Monday is a gesture of goodwill to 482,000 owners of cars whose 2-liter, four-cylinder diesel engines have been implicated in the scandal, the company says. It also includes free roadside assistance for the diesel vehicles for three years. Of note: Owners will not be required to sign anything giving up their right to sue Volkswagen or forcing them into arbitration. There are no strings attached, says a spokeswoman. More than 200 class-action lawsuits have been filed in the US against VW alleging that the scandal caused the diesel cars to drop in value. The offer is designed to keep diesel owners happy as VW works on repairs to the cars, which are programmed to turn on pollution controls during government tests and turn them off on the road. The EPA says the cars emit 10 to 40 times the allowable amount of harmful nitrogen oxide. We are working tirelessly to develop an approved remedy for affected vehicles, says Michael Horn, VW's US CEO. In the meantime we are providing this goodwill package as a first step towards regaining our customers' trust. VW said its Audi luxury brand would launch a similar program Friday.

The Amazon and Central Africa have lost an immense amount of wilderness over the past 20 years or so, but scientists say those regions aren't the only ones in trouble: Nearly 10% of the world's wildlands have succumbed to development and other man-made intrusions since the early 1990s, per a study published in the Current Biology journal. That total area is equal to 1.2 million square milesâ€”what the Guardian estimates to be about the size of two Alaskasâ€”and researchers say if there's not a quick turnaround on the conservation front, there could be zero major wild areas in less than a century. The amount of wilderness loss in just two decades is staggering, Dr. Oscar Venter of the University of Northern British Columbia says, per a press release. Wildnerness, for the purposes of this study, was defined as land that's ecologically largely intact and mostly free of human disturbance, save for indigenous communities. The Amazon claims the lion's share of these catastrophic losses over the past two decades, with about 30% of its wilderness disappeared (and rainforests still being cleared). Central Africa, meanwhile, has suffered a 14% loss. Losing these natural environments isn't just about aesthetics: The study's authors note that widespread development spells disaster for endangered species, threatens biodiversity, and contributes to climate change, as forests hold huge amounts of carbon.

Forty-one years later, Chun Wook-pyo, 68, has made it back home, South Korea today confirmed. He's the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped, says a rep for the Seoul-based Abductees' Family Union, per the Daily Mail. And he's one of thousands of fishermen believed to have been taken by the North across decades, though Pyongyang denies it. Some 450 have never returned home, reports the New York Times. The escape, first reported last month, is rare; the Times reports that eight fisherman are previously said to have made it back since 2000. And the ordeal doesn't necessarily end upon reaching home: According to the Mail, South Korean officials are typically suspicious of escapees like Chun, fearing they could have been indoctrinated by the North and set free as a spy. They may also be concerned that the person claiming to be Chun could in fact be a North Korean agent. Chun was reportedly questioned for two weeks upon his arrival in the South before rejoining his family.

Itâ€™s a chance to channel my inner cave woman, one visitor tells the New York Times, which reports that by year's end, the parks will likely have sold some two million jumbo legs, some 25% more than in 2010. The salt-cured treats, which sell for up to $11.79, have inspired their own range of Disney souvenirs, ranging from hats to magnets to Rice Krispies treats shaped like turkey legs. We always get one because theyâ€™re filling for the price, and theyâ€™re not bad for you, says another visitor. Theyâ€™re actually one of the healthier things here. The Times isn't so sure, given that the legs have some 720 calories and 36 grams of fat each. But they're supposed to be shared, says a Disney rep, and some of those calories can be burnt off in the seven miles the average visitor walks, according to the company.

The elimination of the three most powerful and controversial candidates could go in two directions with just weeks to go before the vote, observers said. It could plunge the Arab world's most populous nation into a new political crisis, or just the opposite, defuse it. Farouk Sultan, the head of the Supreme Presidential Election Commission that was appointed by Egypt's military rulers to oversee the vote, said that those barred from the contest included Mubarak-era strongman Omar Suleiman, Muslim Brotherhood chief strategist Khairat el-Shater, and hard-line Islamist Hazem Abu Ismail. He did not give reasons. Disqualified candidates have 48 hours to appeal the decision, according to election rules.

TEST_709,"(Jun 17, 2016 9:20 AM CDT) A new study out of the University of Utah finds that women with either no sexual partners or oneâ€”most typically, her future spouseâ€”before marriage are the least likely to get divorced within five years; women with 10 or more are the most. A closer look at the numbers, though, reveals what researcher Nicholas H. Wolfinger reports on the Institute for Family Studies' blog to be a complicated picture of the association between sex and marital stability that ultimately raises more questions than it answers. That is, in part, because women who've had exactly two sexual partners before getting married are more likely to get a divorce than women who've had three to nine, and in the 1980s and '90s they were actually more likely to divorce than women with 10 or more sexual partners. In short: If you're going to have comparisons to your [future] husband, it's best to have more than one, Wolfinger says in a Newswise statement. In the 2000s, about 33% of women in the 10+ category saw their marriages end by year five; that fell to 30% for two partners, roughly 25% for three to nine partners, and just over 20% for one. Virgin marriages had just a 6% divorce rate. While the takeaway of news outlets such as the Federalist and Christian Post is that abstinence is key, the Daily Beast takes issue with the fact that women, not men, are placed under the magnifying glass when we examine the effects of premarital sex on marriage. Indeed, Wolfinger notes that the National Survey of Family Growth, which he used, doesn't have full data on men's premarital sexual behavior. (Slept with many people? Here are five ways to see where you rank.)",Exactly ____ Premarital Sex Partners Ups Divorce Rate
